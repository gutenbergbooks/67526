<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Soon after my return to England in 1825, I was
solicited by several friends to publish extracts from
the letters I had written during my residence in
South America. To enable me to do this, I was
kindly furnished with these letters by the individuals
to whom they were addressed. I have at
length attended to these solicitations, with this view
of creating a greater interest in this country on
behalf of that quarter of the world, and in the
expectation that this increased interest will turn out
to the good of South America.</p>

<p>I have to beg the indulgence of my readers in
regard to these letters, from the consideration that
they were not written for publication. There will
appear also some indistinctness, on account of the
letters being addressed to various individuals, whilst
they are here classed simply in the order of time in
which they were written. To which may be added,
among their defects, the abruptness arising from the
circumstance of what is here given being only extracts.
If, however, some interest should be excited
in regard to South America by the publication of
these letters, and if there should arise from this
some good to that country, I shall not be sorry
for thus having given them to the public, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
the disadvantages under which they
appear.</p>

<p>I am now about to return to that quarter of the
world, and trust that the same gracious hand which
protected me and guided me in my former wanderings
there, will still conduct me, and will enable
me to sow seed which may spring up unto eternal
life. Ten days after this date, I embark for Mexico,
as the agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society.
I go fraught with a sacred treasure, with
some thousands of copies of the Holy Scriptures.
Besides circulating these, which are nearly all in
the Spanish language, I am commissioned to procure
translations of the Scriptures into the native
languages of that country, and which are still
spoken there by some millions of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In prosecuting these objects, I intend to travel
over the greater part of Mexico and Guatemala.
Whilst traversing these parts, I shall probably keep
a journal of occurrences, illustrative of the state of
the country in a general point of view; and should
the small volume now published be favourably received,
I may perhaps at some future period have
something for the press less unworthy of public
attention.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><i>Buenos Aires, 5th June, 1820.</i></p>

<p>I cannot be very particular as to all that has
occurred to me since my arrival here, the outlines
will be sufficient. I arrived on the 6th October,
1818, after a voyage from Liverpool of twelve
weeks and three days, and except about a fortnight,
was sick all the time. Soon after my arrival, I
made proposals to the Government, regarding the introduction
of the Lancasterian System of education.
I received promises of meeting with every encouragement
in this matter, but these promises, through
neglect, were long in producing the desired effect.
I was feeling the truth of Solomon’s remark, “Hope
deferred maketh the heart sad.” Under these circumstances
I was proposing to go into the interior,
where I had more positive encouragement held out
to me. Just at this time, by application at a better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
quarter than we had at first applied to, the arrangement
was formed by which I was engaged
by the magistrates to put their schools, in this city
and neighbourhood, upon this plan. Since that
time we have been doing more or less in this business,
but things in general go on very slowly here,
and besides, many political changes have retarded
our operations. Notwithstanding, however, I trust
the foundation of a good work has been laid, by
pursuing of which, I hope to see many thousands
reaping the benefits of education, and imbibing the
soundest principles of religion and morality from
lessons selected from the Holy Scriptures. You
will be surprised and pleased when I tell you, these
lessons are entirely of my own selection, and
printed in this place. In no case, regarding them,
has there been any interference or hindrance on
the part of the clergy or others. We have now a
school going on, with upwards of 100 boys in it,
and soon we expect to have others set a going.
These things, my dear friend, fill me (as they
will do you) with gratitude and thanksgiving.
They are small things, in themselves considered,
but taking into consideration all the circumstances
of this country, they are great, and more especially
when considered as a foundation for future operations.
In another respect also something has been
done, I mean regarding the circulation of the Scriptures.
I have got upwards of 400 Spanish New
Testaments from the British and Foreign Bible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Society, and these I have been able to land here
without the smallest hindrance. Several of them
have been already distributed, and have met with
a ready reception. I have been able also to send
some of them into various parts of the country
here, and into Chile. Where the word of God
circulates, we have every ground to look for good
effects, though it may, like seed sown in the earth,
appear for a while to be lost. By and by, however,
the seed springs up, first the blade, then the
ear, and lastly the full corn in the ear. So shall it
be with the seed of the word of God, which shall
not return void, but shall accomplish the will of
God in turning men from darkness to light.</p>

<p>We are in the midst of political commotions here
at present, and have been so for some time past.
The Lord, however, is the security of his people,
he is the Governor among the nations, and all these
changes will, I trust, lead to the promoting of his
kingdom. Let us join in the prayer, “Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done on earth, as it is done
in heaven.” For the present, farewell.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Buenos Aires, 26th July, 1820.</i></p>

<p>I have got the information contained in your
letters, and the printed sheet translated into Spanish,
and have presented it to the Magistrates, who have
ordered it to be printed in the Buenos Aires Gazette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>I am happy to say the same favourable disposition
towards our objects, continues to prevail in
this place; and that from Monte Video I have
lately received encouraging accounts, which, I
hope, will lead to a commencement in that place.
I went there about three months ago, to see what
could be done. It so happened that General
Lecor, the Portuguese Governor, to whom I had
letters of introduction, was absent at Maldonado,
with the two principal Magistrates. I explained
my objects to the chief clergyman, a liberal man,
and a particular friend of the Governor’s. He
promised to do all he could towards promoting our
system of education on the Governor’s return; and
I some weeks ago received from him a copy of a
letter, which the Magistrates addressed to him
upon the subject, and of which I subjoin a translation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<i>Monte Video, 20th May, 1820.</i></p>

<p>“Sir,—We have read with peculiar pleasure and
attention the memorial which you had the goodness
to send us, relative to the system of instruction
established in Europe by Lancaster. We have the
honour of communicating, that it has met with our
particular esteem; and that in consequence, we
have resolved to adopt the said system in this city,
as soon as Mr. Thomson can come here from
Buenos Aires, to commence it. Please communicate
this to him, and express our sincere thanks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to him for his zeal towards the youth of this province.
May God preserve you many years.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Buenos Aires, 24th May, 1821.</i></p>

<p>I am now about to leave this city, and to proceed
to Chile. I leave the two principal schools
going on as I mentioned in my last, and the masters
of the others instructed in the monitorian system.
What principally enables me to leave the schools
here in the confidence that they will go on well, is,
that they are under the particular care of one who
feels much interest in the new system of instruction,
and of general education. This individual is very
active, and well fitted to carry into execution what
he conceives useful. The person I am speaking of
is a priest. We have been associated together in
the care of the schools for some time, and have
had much intercourse with each other, and we have
always been on the most friendly terms.</p>

<p>It was my intention to leave this, at the latest,
in October next. Things, however, being favourably
arranged, as above mentioned, I have
thought it my duty to set out for Chile without loss
of time. From my former letters you would learn
that the Chilian government has requested me to
go there to establish schools on the Lancasterian
plan. I had promised to go as soon as the state
of the schools here would permit. The Chilian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
government, through their minister here, continues
to shew the same interest as before in regard to this
matter, and has now made an agreement with me.</p>

<p>The season is now far advanced, and the Andes
are covered with snow. Besides this inconvenience
of the mountains, the roads, in some places, are
nearly intercepted, so as to render travelling rather
insecure. From these considerations, I have resolved,
with the advice of my friends, to go by sea,
and have taken my passage in the brig Dragon,
Captain Green, for Valparaiso, in Chile. Sailing
round Cape Horn is by no means so formidable a
matter now as it was formerly considered to be.
Vessels frequently go round now, and at all seasons.
This is now the middle of our winter, and we expect
the cold to be severe. I am accordingly preparing
myself for it, as well as I can, by providing
warm clothing. During the winter the winds are
considered more favourable, and vessels make
quicker passages. We expect to sail in a day or
two, and, I trust, He who guided me over the ocean
in coming to this place, will still be with me to
preserve me, and to bring me safely to my desired
haven.</p>

<p>I leave all my friends here on the best terms, and
I leave the place, in many respects with regret. I
shall never forget all the kindness I have met with
in this city from the Magistrates, and from all
classes with whom I have had intercourse. May
God reward them. When I gave in my resignation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
I said that it was my intention to return here
next summer, to visit the schools, and to see how
they were coming on. In the kindest manner I
was requested not to forget my promise of returning.
They were sorry, they said, that it was not in their
power to reward me in a pecuniary way, from the
lowness of their funds. They begged me to accept
of their sincerest thanks for establishing this system
of education in the country, from which they said
they anticipated the happiest results, in making
education general throughout all classes of the
people; and they added that, as a mark of
respect, they had requested the government to confer
on me the honour of citizenship, and which was
accordingly done.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 6th Aug. 1821.</i></p>

<p>My letter to you of the 16th July, brought down
my journal to the day before my leaving Valparaiso.
On the 17th I left that place in the afternoon, and
at two o’clock on the 19th I said, “Peace be to
this city!” I was going to give you some account
of the road, and what I met with upon it, but find
I have got other things to write which will fill my
letter. I shall leave this description till a further
opportunity.</p>

<p>You know, already, that I was engaged to
come here by this government, and that my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
passage round the Cape was paid by the same.
I therefore looked for a fair and open reception.
I have not been disappointed, or, perhaps,
I should rather say I have, for I have met
with a reception beyond my expectation, I might
say to my wish. I have been introduced to the
Director and to the Ministers of Government, all
of whom express much desire for the speedy establishment
of schools <em>throughout</em> Chile. We have
got the largest apartment in the University for a
school-room. The joiners are busy at work,
fitting it up, and we only wait their finishing to
begin our operations.</p>

<p>I shall occupy the rest of my letter in giving
you a translation of two articles, which bear
upon this subject.</p>

<p>On my arrival here, I received a copy of the
following order, issued by the Government two
days before I reached this city:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By supreme authority of this date, I communicate
to Don Manuel Salas the following note.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thomson, who has been engaged to establish
in this city the new system of mutual instruction, has
already arrived in Valparaiso. His Excellency, the
Director, has a decided wish that public education
may be general, and is very anxious to give all possible
aid to this establishment for elementary instruction,
as preparatory to the higher branches. He
has for this end appointed you with full powers
to forward this object, in conjunction with Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Thomson, and the President of the Board of Public
Education. You will, therefore, do all in your
power to establish it as soon and as perfectly as
possible.—A copy of this order to be sent to the
President of Public Education, and to Mr.
Thomson.”</p>

<p class="center">“Office of the Minister of State in Santiago
de Chile, 17th July, 1821.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Joaquin de Echevarria.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Upon enquiring who this Don Manuel Salas
was, I found he was a man very highly respected
by every one, and a modest but decided philanthropist.
I have since been frequently with him,
and find him, indeed, as described to me. I next
give you an article from the Public Gazette of the
4th current; I think it is from the pen of Salas,
but this is only conjecture. It is, however, either
from him or from one of the Ministers of Government.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“PUBLIC EDUCATION.</p>

<p>“Ignorance is one of the greatest evils that man
can suffer, and it is the principal cause of all his
errors and miseries. It is also the grand support
of tyranny, and ought, therefore, to be banished
by every means from that country which desires a
liberty regulated by laws, customs, and opinion.
None can be happy unless he study religion, morality,
and his own rights, unless he improve by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
knowledge of those who have preceded him, and
enter into social connexion, as it were, with those
who in former times, and in other places, cultivated
the sciences and the arts, and who have deposited
in their writing, the fruit of their studies for the
improvement of others. The only way by which
we can form such an acquaintance with great men
is <em>by reading</em>. The happy day is now arrived when
the infinitely valuable art of reading is to be extended
to every individual in Chile. We have
now the pleasure of announcing this to all classes
of the community. This will be considered as the
most interesting news, by those who know its importance,
and who consider it as the basis of solid
prosperity. Deeply impressed with this truth, our
benevolent government has brought to this place
Mr. James Thomson, who has established in Buenos
Aires elementary schools upon that admirable
system of Lancaster, which has spread through the
world. He is going to establish schools on the
same plan in this city, from which, as a centre, this
system will be propagated through all the towns
of the state. The readiness with which this mode
of education has been generally adopted, its
economy, and the quickness and order with which
children learn by it reading, writing, arithmetic,
and the principles of grammar, strongly recommend
it. It has been particularly useful in those places
where rural or mechanical occupations allow but a
short time for instruction. There is, therefore, now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
no obstacle in the way for every one in Chile to
obtain education. Notice will be given, from time
to time, of the progress of the central school, which
is to serve as a model for others. In it masters
will be instructed, and those masters who show the
most attention in acquiring a knowledge of this
system will be appointed in preference to the other
schools.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 8th October, 1821.</i></p>

<p>I seize the opportunity of sending you a few lines
by his Majesty’s ship Owen Glendower, which sails
for England from Valparaiso immediately. I enclose
you a copy of a letter of this date to Mr.
Owen, which will inform you of my concerns here,
touching the Bible Society, to this date. In addition
to this, I shall now communicate to you some
notices regarding our schools here, bringing down
my accounts upon the subject from the 1st September
(the date of my last letter to Mr. S.) to the
present day.</p>

<p>I am happy to say, the favourable reception
I met with here, and of which I wrote you on the
6th August, was not a momentary feeling. It has
been kept up till now, and I might also say, it
has rather increased than diminished. Soon after
my arrival in this city, a large room in the University
was pointed out to me as the place in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
which we were to begin our school operations.
This hall is capable of containing 200 children,
according to our plan, and this is a very good
number for a model school. This hall was to have
been the University Chapel. The building I here
call the University, is not occupied at present in
the way its name would indicate, though intended
for a place of learning. There is, however, another
building appropriated to the objects of a college,
and of which I may write you afterwards. My
present object is to speak of our schools. Through
the delay of the joiners in fitting up this place,
it was not completed till the 17th September. On
that day our school was opened. From day to
day our number increased, till, at the end of a
fortnight, our number (200) was completed. Since
that time, we have been daily importuned to admit
others, which we are unable to do. We are,
however, about to commence fitting up another
large hall in the University buildings. At the
present rate of applications, we shall certainly
have more in readiness for that second school,
by the time it is prepared, than it will contain.
The fitting up of others is also talked of. From
the short time our school has been going on, it
promises to do well. The children are docile and
agreeable. I am now so much familiarized with
the appearance and manner of the children in these
countries, that I feel myself quite at home among
them. There is more resemblance to the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
or European face among the children and others
here, in Chile, than in Buenos Aires. I have been
<em>this moment</em> interrupted by one of my scholars,
who has called upon me, and brought me a ham,
a present from his mother.</p>

<p>All classes seem to take an interest in our
schools. We are daily visited. The First Minister
of the Government pays us a visit regularly every
afternoon. We have already four masters studying
the system, and these will be ready in a month
or two to open schools on our plan, either in this
city or in the provincial towns. In Conception,
Coquimbo, and another town of inferior population,
they are preparing for establishing schools upon
our system. The principal things we stand in need
of for the rapid extension of our schools, are slates
and printed lessons. I am expecting 2000 slates
by the first vessel from England, and am at
present getting some lessons printed in the government
printing office. To defray the expense of
these, we have opened a subscription, which I
hope will do well. I have already got upwards
of 270 dollars among my English friends here, and
expect more.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, the Lord is with us, and blessed
be his name. May he, in his own way and wisdom,
make his great name glorious in the eyes of
Chile, and of all South America.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 8th October, 1821.</i></p>

<p>I wrote you a few lines on the 26th February,
and then mentioned that it was my intention to
visit Chile. Through the gracious providence of
the God of the Bible Society, I have now effected
my intention. I left Buenos Aires on the 30th
May, and sailing round Cape Horn, arrived safely
at Valparaiso, after a voyage of forty-four days.
After a short stay in that place, to recruit my
health, which always suffers at sea, I came to this
city, the capital of Chile. Here, the moment of
my arrival, I met with a very encouraging reception.
You know, of course, that my most prominent
object in South America is the promoting
of education on the Lancasterian plan. On this
footing it was that I experienced so hearty a reception
in this place. Great and respected as your
Society is, and ought to be, in the eyes of England
and of Europe, it would yet be an imprudence to
proclaim one’s self your agent here, with the sole
or chief object of circulating the Bible. This is
not speaking very favourably of the inhabitants of
South America, you will say. I confess it, but
at the same time, I have told you the truth.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Whilst,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
however, I hold myself forward in the eyes of
South America, as a promoter of education and
an instructor of youth, I consider myself in all
respects as the servant of the British and Foreign
Bible Society. I beg you to consider me in this
light, and to call upon me with the utmost freedom
in whatever way I can, directly or indirectly,
promote your blessed work, in making the inhabitants
of this vast continent acquainted with
the words of eternal life. I have said, my prominent
object here is the establishment of schools.
I freely and openly profess this, and in consequence
am every where hailed as a friend. The little
influence I have thus acquired, and the confidence
reposed in me, enable me more effectually to promote
the circulation of the Scriptures, than if I
acted ostensibly and exclusively as your agent.
One proof of this I shall give you. I brought with
me among my books from Buenos Aires, about
sixty Spanish New Testaments. In getting my
luggage through the custom-house, I was told,
that the books must be inspected by the Bishop.
I wished this might be dispensed with, but it
was insisted on. I then told the officers, that I
was engaged to come here by the Government
to establish the Lancasterian schools. That alters
the case, said they, and immediately the papers
for despatching my books, &amp;c. were signed, and
not a single book was so much as looked at either
by the Bishop, or by any of the custom-house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
officers. I was told, before coming here, that
there was much less liberality in Chile, as to the
circulation of the Scriptures, than in Buenos Aires.
I was, therefore, anxious to avoid the inspection
of the Bishop above noticed. I understand he
has it in his power to prohibit what books he
chooses, and that his prohibition holds, unless the
Government give, in the individual case, an order
to the contrary. I am in expectation of receiving
from you very soon 300 of Scio’s translation of
the New Testament. These I shall let pass all
the forms required, to make proof whether or not
the Scriptures are allowed to be introduced into
Chile. This, you will perceive, is an object worth
ascertaining, and the knowledge of it will be of
considerable use in directing us in future. Should
the Bishop demur as to their circulation, and wish
to keep them, I can, I think, obtain an order of
the Government to prevent it; so that we may
consider there is no great danger of losing them,
in making the trial referred to.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what I have said above, no
interruption to the circulation of the Spanish New
Testament has yet been experienced. Soon after
my arrival, I gave to an Englishman, who has a
shop here, some copies to sell. This man is a
Roman Catholic, and I am happy to say, he
recommends the Scriptures to the natives of this
country, who are of his own religion. He has
already sold about twenty. He is very anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
for the arrival of the Spanish Bibles, which I told
him I expected, as he thinks he could sell many of
them.</p>

<p>In my letters to you, from time to time, when in
Buenos Aires, I related to you the state of the
circulation of the Scriptures in that place. I am
happy to say, that at my leaving it, the prospects
regarding this important matter were more
favourable than at any former period. I do not
mean to say by this, that there was any particular
stir about the word of God, or great demand for
it; but I mean to convey to you this encouraging
truth, that the Scriptures are occasionally
bought, and more so than formerly, and that they
are increasingly read from year to year. I consider
the word of God to have fairly got an entrance
into Buenos Aires; and that its prohibition,
or any material hindrance to its circulation, is not
only unlikely, but, one might say, impossible.
I give you this as my opinion, after a residence
in that place of more than two years and a half,
and an intercourse with various classes of society
during that time.</p>

<p>I shall now mention some things not formerly
noticed, regarding the circulation of the Scriptures
in Buenos Aires, and in the surrounding country.—A
military officer, commanding on a station a
short distance from the city, has been greatly delighted
with the New Testament, and in consequence,
very anxious to make others acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with it. He recommended the reading of it to
several poor people who were unable to purchase
it, and requested to have copies to give them,
which he obtained. In this way he has distributed
a number of copies. Besides those given
to the poor, some have been sold by him to those
able to pay for them. He used to take me very
cordially by the hand when we met, and to speak
with pleasure on the beneficence of the Bible
Society, and of the great advantages that would
arise to his countrymen by a general reading of
the Holy Scriptures. I told him I hoped soon
to have the whole Bible in Spanish, and in consequence
he is all expectation for it. On my leaving
Buenos Aires, I gave twenty-four New Testaments
to this gentleman, in the confidence of
their being distributed in the most judicious
manner.</p>

<p>There is a military station and a small town on
the east coast of Patagonia, called Rio Negro, in
about 42° south latitude. To this place some
copies of the New Testament have been sent.
One individual, a native of that place, was so
pleased with the copy he got, that he requested
the person who brought it, to bring several copies
on his return for his family and friends. I am
personally acquainted with the officer at present
commanding at that place, and am pretty
certain he will not throw any obstacle in the way
of the circulation of the Scriptures. This gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
attended our school in Buenos Aires, and
took with him lessons, &amp;c. to establish schools on
his arrival in that place, for which he sailed in
May last. The lessons I have referred to I got
printed in Buenos Aires for our schools. They
are selections from the Scriptures. These lessons,
now used in most of the schools, will greatly contribute,
I hope, to create a desire to possess the
sacred volume, a book which has hitherto been
little known in this country.</p>

<p>A Patagonian chief, called Cualli Piachepolon,
in the very centre of Patagonia, is in possession of
one of your Testaments. This man has been in
the habit of visiting Buenos Aires for some years,
in order to exchange the few commodities which
his country at present produces, for those of Europe.
He has hence acquired some knowledge of the
Spanish language. Upon hearing some passages
of the New Testament read to him, he requested to
have the book, that he might, on his return, explain
it to his people.</p>

<p>Some copies have been sent to Tucuman, to
Salta, &amp;c.; so that your bounty is known, more
or less throughout the provinces of the Rio de la
Plata; and I have no doubt but, some hundred
years hence, the then populous banks of that king
of rivers, and the circumjacent country, will gratefully
remember the present Committee and Members
of the British and Foreign Bible Society.</p>

<p>I close my account of Buenos Aires, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
present, by noticing, that some individuals, upon
obtaining the New Testament, and hearing of your
great and extended efforts in distributing the Holy
Scriptures, wondered how they had been taught
that the English were not Christians. When
speaking on religion, it is common to use the word
Christian and Protestant in contradistinction to
each other, meaning, by the former, themselves or
Roman Catholics in general, and by the latter, the
English or Protestants in general.</p>

<p>A short time before I left the Rio de la Plata,
I sent ten of the Portuguese Bibles, and twenty
New Testaments, to Bahia, in charge of a person
who, I think, would take care to see them safely
lodged in that place. I sent them to the care of
the English Chaplain there.</p>

<p>During the few days I stopped at Valparaiso,
I met with a gentleman to whom I had formerly
intrusted twelve of the Spanish New Testaments.
Upon my enquiring about them, he told me they
had been stolen out of his room. Though this was
to be regretted, yet one good effect would arise
from it, in as much as the person who stole them
would no doubt take effectual care to put them in
circulation.</p>

<p>In my letter of 26th February, I requested the
Society to send me 200 of Scio’s translation to
Buenos Aires, and 300 to Valparaiso. I hope
these will respectively arrive in due time. I then
noticed to you the advantage that would arise from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
lettering them on the back, and varying them in
the binding. I particularly request your attention
to this, as I am sure it will contribute greatly
to their sale. Let the binding be in many cases
elegant. They would thus be more expensive to
the Society at first, but they would be considerably
less in the end. It is my intention to <em>sell</em> them
in future, except when a favourable opportunity
occurs of giving the word of God to a person in
real poverty. This I know to be the uniform recommendation
of the Society. I would beg leave
to suggest to you, that no Bibles or New Testaments
be sent out in future to Buenos Aires by the
captains of ships. The captains, however well
intentioned they may be, cannot stay to distribute
them. The Testaments, in consequence, have not
unfrequently come into hands who wish to get rid
of them in any way. By this means they become,
as it were, of too little consideration, and their <em>sale</em>
is thus also prevented, which no doubt is the most
effectual way of distributing them. In Buenos
Aires several persons objected to buying them, because
they had formerly been got for nothing. I
shall, as I have said above, most readily act as
your agent in distributing the Scriptures in Buenos
Aires, and in Chile. The most judicious and
effectual way of doing this is through the booksellers
in these places. Before leaving Buenos
Aires I arranged for the continued circulation of
the New Testament, and here I shall make arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to the same effect before I go. It is
my intention to visit Peru before long; and I shall
there also, and indeed wherever I may be, zealously
endeavour to promote the good work in
which you are engaged.</p>

<p>In a few years South America will have large
claims on your Society, but she will pay you from
her mines for all your kindness. Should the Lord
spare me ten or twenty years, I have no doubt
I shall see wonderful and blessed changes on this
continent. It is my intention, through the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to spend my life (long or
short as it may be) in South America; probably
not in any fixed place, but residing from time to
time wherever I may most effectually promote the
work of the Lord, in establishing schools, in circulating
the Scriptures, and in the use of such other
means as circumstances may direct.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Some letters towards the end will show, that this was
too unfavourable a conclusion, but it was the opinion I
entertained from what I had then seen of the country.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 1st Dec. 1821.</i></p>

<p>Before this reaches you, the taking of Lima
by San Martin, will be known in England. I
need not expatiate upon this subject to you. You
must see at once how much our field is thereby
extended. I may truly say, the fall of Lima is
as great a blow to the kingdom of Satan here, as
it is to the cause of Spain in South America.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
From what I have learned of San Martin, I am
sure he will prove a great forwarder of our cause
there, and indeed wherever he may be. The rejoicings
here on account of the fall of Lima have
been very great, and they still continue. The fall
of that strong hold of the Spaniards, is at once the
liberty of Peru, and the stability of Chile; and
I may add too, the independence of South America.</p>

<p>We are about to form a School Society in this
city, which I hope will be attended with happy
results. The Director condescends to be the Patron
of the Society, and his first minister is to be
President. We are looking around us for the
most patriotic and liberal men of the city to form
a Committee. Our Society may not be able to
do what a similar Society would do in England;
but it may, however, do something, and may considerably
forward our objects here on behalf of
the inhabitants of Chile. Besides the establishing
and superintending of schools throughout the state,
there is another object to which the Society will
greatly contribute, I mean, the printing of some
elementary works for the schools, and for the
children to read in their own houses. This is a
part of our work, which I consider of great importance,
and to which I intend to turn a considerable
part of my time and attention, so soon as other
matters will allow.</p>

<p>I believe I wrote you, before leaving Buenos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Aires, that I had sent a Master to Monte Video,
or that I was about to send one. He had not left
Buenos Aires when I came away, as he was occupied
in printing a grammar, which he had written
for the use of our schools. I have lately received
a letter from him, of which I shall give you an
extract.—“On the 4th of this month (July) I
arrived in this city with the slates and lessons you
gave me for the schools here. On the following
day, I presented myself to Larañaga, (the chief
ecclesiastic in Monte Video,) and he introduced
me to General Lecor, the Governor, to whom I
gave your letter. I met with a very hearty reception
from the general, as also from Larañaga,
and the magistrates. On the 9th, we had assigned
to us for a school-room, a large hall in the
Fort. This hall will hold 200 children. The general
sent the joiners and masons of the Government
to prepare this school, and I am in hopes
we shall be able to open it in three weeks. I am
making endeavours to form a School Society here,
which may take under its management the schools
of this city and province. I am in great expectation
of succeeding in this object, as the members
of the Government are very well disposed to
it.”</p>

<p>In the end of this month, I am thinking of
crossing the Andes, to verify my long intended
visit to Mendoza. The printing of our lessons is
nearly finished, and I shall thus be enabled to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
some with me for the supply of that place. You
will see by the extracts of letters I gave from
Mendoza, in my last letter to Mr. H. (Nov. 1st),
that things there are very promising. I hope my
expectations regarding their improvements will be
more than realized. The snow still continues on
the mountains, as I am informed by a gentleman
just come over them. I hope it will be nearly all
gone by the time I set out. It has continued, I understand,
for an unusual length of time this season.</p>

<p>I shall leave the schools in my absence, under
the care of an Englishman lately come here from
London. This gentleman was engaged by the
agent there of this Government, for the purpose of
establishing Lancasterian schools here. Upon his
arrival, it was the intention of the Government to
send him to Conception. I thought, however, it
would be better that he should stay here to instruct
the school-masters in grammar, geography, &amp;c.,
whilst they were studying the system in our school.
To this proposal the Government cheerfully agreed.
We have in consequence a separate class in the
school, in which Mr. Eaton instructs the masters,
and two or three more who choose to attend.
This arrangement will prove, I hope, highly advantageous
to the education of the country at large,
as those, who in future take charge of schools, will
be better qualified for this important office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 30th Jan. 1822.</i></p>

<p>As I know you and your good friends of the
British and Foreign School Society take a deep
interest in all things here relative to education,
I send you an extract from the Chile Gazette of
the 19th current, by which you will see that our
endeavours to form a School Society here have not
been in vain.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The surest method of promoting the happiness
of any country is to make all the people in it well
informed and industrious. An end has at length
been put to the obstacles which prevented the natives
of Chile from enjoying those blessings which
are enjoyed by other nations less favoured by
nature, but who have preceded us in the cultivation
of literature and the arts. It is hence necessary
now to strain every nerve to regain that time
which in idleness and darkness has been thrown
away. We begin, then, by offering an opportunity
of acquiring knowledge to all classes of the
community, without respect of rank or fortune, of
sex or age.</p>

<p>“The Lancasterian system of mutual instruction,
now introduced in most parts of the civilized
world, and to which many places already owe an
improvement in their habits, has been established
amongst us, and in such a manner as prognosticates
its beneficial effects. The propagation of this system
holds out the surest means of extirpating those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
principles formed amongst us during the time of
darkness. The government has resolved zealously
to protect this establishment, and, as the best way
of fulfilling its intention, has resolved to unite with
it in this object those persons who have the same
sentiments on the subject, and who, at the same
time, possess that activity, zeal, and energy, which
this important matter demands. In all places this
system of instruction prospers and extends itself
under the fostering care of societies. This circumstance
at once determines me to follow the example
thus set before us, and immediately to establish
a Society for this object. Of this Society I shall
be the protector and a member. My first minister
of state will be President. The Solicitor General
of the City, the Protector of the City Schools,
and the Rector of the National Institute, shall be
<i>ex-officio</i> members of the Committee of Management.
The other members of the Committee will
in future be chosen by the Society; but, for the
present, I nominate to this charge:— * * * *</p>

<p>“The Committee will hold its meetings in the
room belonging to the Central School, on such
days as shall be agreed on at the first meeting,
with no other formality than what is dictated by
good order. The Committee shall form rules for
the Society, and present them to the Government
for approbation, and shall name a Secretary, Accountant,
and Treasurer, either from their own
number or otherwise. The object of this Institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
is to extend, in every direction throughout
Chile, the benefits of education; to promote the
instruction of all classes, but especially of the
poor; to seize all the advantages which this new
system of education offers; and to point out those
means by which it may be best adapted to the
circumstances and necessities of the country. In
short, this Institution will be considered a good of
the greatest magnitude, and whose efficacies will,
we trust, in some measure correspond to that great
extension of which it is susceptible.</p>

<p class="center">(Signed)</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">O’Higgins.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>I trust this Society, which has thus been formed,
will be extremely useful in forwarding the great
concerns of general education in this rising nation.
There are many circumstances here very encouraging
in regard to the future prospects and prosperity
of Chile. It is probable our Society will
communicate with you before long, by way of
claiming alliance with you in the grand work of
universal instruction.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Santiago de Chile, 9th May, 1822.</i></p>

<p>You have heard, I dare say, that I left Buenos
Aires some time ago, and came to Chile. I have
now been here ten months, and am much pleased
with this country. In as far as respects the climate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
I believe no country can be more desirable to live
in than this. It rains a good deal in the winter
season, that is, from June to September inclusive.
Frost and snow are seldom or never seen in the
plains; notwithstanding, a fire is very desirable in
the winter. The highest ridge of the Andes is full
in sight from this city. This is covered with snow
all the year round. When it rains here below, it
uniformly snows on the mountains. In the summer
season, we have no rain at all, and very few
cloudy days. The common course of the seasons
is four months of occasional rains, and eight months
of fair weather. In the summer it is pretty hot
during the day; but it is always very comfortable
at night. In Buenos Aires, on the contrary, the
nights, during the summer, are generally very warm.
In another respect also, Buenos Aires differs very
remarkably from this country. There, not a mountain,
nor a hill, nor a rock is to be seen; here, all
those abound. The natives of Buenos Aires, who
have never been from home, have no idea of what
a mountain is like;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of snow they are equally
ignorant, having never seen the one or the other.
They would also be ignorant of what a stone is,
were it not that some have been brought from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
other side of the river, for paving the streets. After
what I have said of the scarcity of stones, you may
judge of the correctness of a very modern work on
South America, in which it is said, “All the
houses in Buenos Aires are built of a fine white
stone, found in quarries in the neighbourhood.”
There is not, in Buenos Aires, a single house built
of stone, nor is there any quarry on that side of the
river within 100 miles of Buenos Aires. The
houses there are all built of brick. The mentioning
of this last, brings me back again to Chile. All
the houses here, or nearly all, are built of <em>unburnt</em>
brick, such bricks as the Israelites made in Egypt;
they are made of earth mixed with straw. It is said,
this material for building suits the country best,
on account of earthquakes, which are not unfrequent.
Last night, just about this hour, (eight
o’clock) we had a smart shock. I was sitting
writing, when my attention was called by a rumbling
noise, and a clattering of the window shutters.
In a few seconds, the whole house shook,
and the creaking of the beams and joists was very
distinct. The noise continued for a few seconds
after the shock, when all ceased. This is now the
fourth earthquake we have had in less than a
week. They prevail most, I am told, in this
month.</p>

<p>We have now got our schools set on foot in this
place, and I am thinking of going to Lima in the
course of a month or less, in order to prosecute my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
objects there. According to the best information,
the new state of things in that country goes on wonderfully.
Many reforms are taking place of a very
salutary nature. Gaming, which is carried on to
a very hurtful extent in all South America, has
just been prohibited in Lima, by the Government.
Acts have passed for the gradual abolition of
slavery. Since the taking of Lima, all the children
of slaves are born free. The importation of
slaves is entirely prohibited, and no infringement
of the Act takes place. The same state of things
subsists here and in Buenos Aires, regarding this
shameful business. There is in South America
generally, I believe, a great desire for the increase
of knowledge. I can bear witness, that this is
the case, in those parts I have been in; and I
doubt not of finding it so in Lima also. I am told,
that learning has prevailed there more than in
places to the south of it, on this continent. There
are several men there, I am informed, who stand
tolerably high in literature. About three months
ago, a literary society was formed in Lima. I
have sent a translation of the Act incorporating
the Society to Professor Jameson, of Edinburgh,
and it may perhaps appear in the Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal.</p>

<p>The fall of Lima decided, I think, the contest
between Spain and her colonies, fairly establishing
the independence of the latter. If any thing,
however, was wanting to complete this state of
things, it has now been accomplished by the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
occurrences in Mexico. The immediate and solid
advantages occurring from this independence, to
the cause of our fellow-men in this continent, are
very great. Knowledge is now tolerated in the
country, and also patronized. A war of extermination
has been declared against ignorance, and is
actually waged. Soon after San Martin entered
Lima, a provisional law was issued, until a new
code should be formed for the country. In this
provisional law, religious toleration is publicly acknowledged,
for the first time, in South America.</p>

<p>A most wonderful change has taken place in
Buenos Aires since I left it. War, anarchy,
and confusion, have given place to a steady, firm,
and enlightened government. The principal cause
of this happy change is the present minister of state,
Rivadavia. He arrived in Buenos Aires a short
time before I left it. For some years past he has resided
in London and in Paris; and the time he has
spent in these places has been well employed. He
has there studied and is now practising the soundest
principles of political economy. If Buenos Aires
goes on for a few years as it has done for some
months past, it will afford excellent lessons in this
interesting science to the nations of Europe, perhaps
to the country of Adam Smith. A fine
emulation will be carried on, and is already begun,
between Buenos Aires and Lima. If an improvement
is proposed in one of these places, it is
deemed sufficient to silence popular and low prejudice,
to publish that such a thing has already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
been done in the other. As to the Chilians, they
are, generally speaking, less enlightened and more
indifferent in respect to these subjects. Our Director
is a good man, truly desirous of the progress of
Chile in every thing useful. He has, however,
but little activity or zeal. It is pleasing to see,
under these circumstances, the good effects produced
on us here, by the newspapers of Lima on
the one hand, and of Buenos Aires on the other.
From these many articles are copied into our public
journals; and some things are already begun
among us, in imitation of our friends in the north
and on the east. I lately crossed and recrossed
the Andes on a visit to Mendoza and San Juan.
The cause of knowledge and of truth goes on there
also. In each of these places there is a printing-press,
and from these are likely to issue soon, many
things which will contribute to the general good.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The river La Plata, opposite Buenos Aires, is thirty miles

side is visible. To this extent the Buenos Aireans know what
a mountain is.</p>

<p>Through the unceasing goodness of God towards
me, I have now arrived safely in this city.
On the 18th of last month I sailed from Valparaiso,
and after a pleasant passage of ten days we
cast anchor in Callao Bay. Callao is an excellent
harbour, the best I have yet seen. It will hold
almost any number of ships riding in great safety.
It is well defended from all winds except the north,
but it scarcely ever blows from that quarter. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
consequence of an order from the Government that
no passengers should be allowed to land until they
receive a licence or passport from Lima, I had to
defer my coming here till the day after our arrival;
I got permission, however, from the captain of the
port to go on shore. After viewing Callao, I went
to take a view of the place where the former
Callao stood, which was destroyed by the earthquake,
of which of course you have read. Its site
is about half a mile from where the present town
stands. The destruction seems to have been complete.
Not a house is now standing; but walls of
houses of considerable thickness are to be seen
scattered all over the place. Some of these are
lying <em>flat</em>, and others are half turned over. How
weak is man, and all his works, when God arises
to shake the earth!</p>

<p>On the day on which I arrived in this city, I
called on San Martin, and delivered him the letters
of introduction which I had brought from Chile.
He opened one of the letters, and observing its
purport, said “Mr. Thomson! I am extremely
glad to see you;” and he rose up, and gave me a
very hearty embrace. He would not, he said, be
lavish in compliments, but would assure me of his
great satisfaction at my arrival; and said, that
nothing should be wanting on his part to further the
object which had brought me to Peru. Next day
as I was sitting in my room, a carriage stopped at
the door, and my little boy came running in crying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
San Martin! San Martin! In a moment he
entered the room, accompanied by one of his ministers.
I would have had him step into another apartment
of the house more suited to his reception;
but he said the room was very well, and sat down
on the first chair he reached. We conversed about
our schools, and other similar objects for some
time; and in going away he desired me to call on
him next morning, and said he would introduce me
to the Marquis of Truxillo, who is at present what
is called the Supreme Deputy or Regent. I called
on him accordingly next morning, and he took me
with him and introduced me to the Marquis, and to
each of the ministers.</p>

<p>From all the members of the government I have
received great encouragement. On the 6th current
an order was issued relative to our schools, and
published in the Lima Gazette of the same date.
I am going to write Mr. Millar to-morrow, and
shall give him a translation of this order or decree,
a copy of which will of course be sent you. By
this order one of the convents is appropriated to
the schools, and is now in our possession. I believe
the convents here will decrease in number as
the schools multiply. There is no contest or
balancing of powers between the civil and ecclesiastical
powers in this place. The former has
the latter entirely at their nod. The case in regard
to this convent is a proof of what I have said. The
order for the friars to remove was given on Saturday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
on Monday they began to remove, and on
Tuesday the keys were delivered up.</p>

<p>From all I have seen during the short time I
have been here, I cannot doubt of the great benefits
which this country will derive from the new
state of things. San Martin and his first minister,
(and also the others) seem truly anxious to characterize
the times by improvements—by solid improvements.
They wish to encourage foreigners,
and to improve the state of the country in every
point of view. I have already mentioned to you
my representation made to the Chilian government
just before leaving that place, regarding the bringing
out of tradesmen and farmers. I showed a
copy of this representation to San Martin; he read
it very carefully over, and concluded by saying,
“Excellent!” He then told me what was his opinion
on the subject, and proposed a plan for carrying it
into effect, much more likely to succeed than the
one I had stated. I am to draw up this plan in
order, and to present it to him, that it may be
sanctioned and carried into effect. I therefore
consider this matter, so far as regards Peru, as
fairly begun. The particulars of the plan I may
send you afterwards. In the mean time, that you
may see that in these matters I am not losing sight
of my chief object, I shall mention to you one
sentence of the representation referred to. It is
this, “The men who will be most useful to South
America, are men truly religious and of sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
morality.” The minister of Chile, upon reading this
sentence, said, “That is very true;” and San Martin
expressed himself in a similar manner upon my
stating the same thing to him.</p>

<p>What an immeasurable field is South America;
and how white it is to the harvest! I have told
you this repeatedly, but I have a pleasure in telling
it to you again. I do think that, since the world
began, there never was so fine a field for the exercise
of benevolence in all its parts. The man of
science, the moralist, the christian, have all fine
scope here for their talents. God, who has opened
such a door, will surely provide labourers.</p>

<p>My present intention is to continue here about
six months, and then to move on northwards. I
may, however, be kept longer here than I intend,
but I am anxious to get to England as soon as possible.
My stay here will depend much on the
facility or difficulty of obtaining good masters for
the school. This I find, from experience, a matter
of so great importance, that I intend to pay every
attention to it; and I have it now in my power
more than ever to do so, having represented to the
government the necessity of encouragement, by offering
employment and a good salary to those who
thoroughly study the system, and are able to put
it in practice; and this encouragement I am authorised
to give.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 12th July, 1822.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to you was written a few days
before my leaving Chile. I then apprized you of
the state of things there at that time, and of my
intention of setting out for this place. Through
the blessing of God, I arrived safely in this
country on the 28th of last month, and have now
to state to you how things look here, in reference
to that truly important object—<span class="smcap">education</span>.</p>

<p>I believe I told you, some time ago, that
from various circumstances I expected every encouragement
would be given to our object here
by San Martin. I have not been disappointed
in this. My expectations have all been fulfilled,
and more than fulfilled. San Martin is
most <em>decidedly</em> a friend to general, to universal
education. I hope none of the members of the
Committee of the British and Foreign School Society
will be offended, but rather gratified, when
I say, that they are not more friendly to this
object than San Martin. Because I have come
to Peru to promote this object, I have received
from him every mark of respect and personal
attention, as well as every encouragement to proceed
in this work. The Marquis of Truxillo, and
each of the ministers of government, feel deeply
interested in the same object. Blessed be God
for this encouragement. In his hand are the hearts
of all, and he inclineth them to whatsoever he will.
Surely the days draw nigh, when ignorance shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
be ashamed to walk about any where in open
day. May the glorious war now waged against
her be a war of extermination. It will I trust
be so, and when this enemy of mankind shall
be slain, the British and Foreign School Society
shall be clothed with her spoils, and be
crowned with never fading laurel. Is it wrong
to indulge pleasing prospects of the future amelioration
of mankind? Is it sinful to cherish
the hope of better times for this poor unfortunate
world? I think it is not. If it is right
to pray “Thy will be done on earth, as it is
done in heaven,” it cannot be wrong to expect
that this prayer, daily reiterated from the mouth
of thousands, will one day be heard, and be
answered in all its extent; and when the will
of God is done in this world, as it is done
above, then shall the felicity on earth resemble
the felicity of heaven.</p>

<p>The following is a translation of a decree of
this government relative to the Schools, and which
was published in the Lima Gazette of the 6th
current.</p>

<p>“Preamble.—Without education there is properly
speaking no society. Men may indeed live together
without it, but they cannot know the extent
of the duties, and the rights which bind them
one to another, and it is in the right knowledge
of these duties and rights that the well being
of society consists. The bringing of education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
to any degree of perfection, is, from the nature
of the thing, slow. To accomplish it, time is required,
and some degree of stability in the government,
as well as some other circumstances,
both natural and moral. All these must combine,
in order that the education of the people may
become general, and that thus a foundation may
be laid for the continuance of those Institutions
which may be established among them. Of the
various improvements which the government has
been desirous of making, none has been more
earnestly and constantly kept in view since the
moment of its commencement, than the reformation
of public education. In those intervals
of tranquillity which have been enjoyed from
the clamour of arms, this object has occupied
their attention; and though the sun has not
stood still, they have found in activity the secret
of doubling the length of the day.</p>

<p>“It has already been announced, in various
decrees of the government, that the introduction
of the Lancasterian system in the public schools,
was one of the plans in meditation. It is not
yet possible to calculate the revolution which
will be produced in the world by this system
of mutual instruction, on its becoming general
throughout the civilized world. When this shall
take place, ignorance shall come to an end, or
at least shall be reduced to certain limits, beyond
which it shall never be allowed to pass. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
time is now arrived for setting this system agoing
in this place, and the commencing of it is worthy
of the month of July—a month in which posterity
will record many events of importance;
and we trust they will do us the justice to
declare, that we have desired to make this time
memorable by deeds which philosophy applauds,
and which spring from the noblest principles
of all human actions, namely, the love
of glory, founded on promoting the prosperity
and happiness of mankind. The above are the
reasons on which the following decree is founded.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Supreme Deputy, with the advice of the
Privy Council, decrees—</p>

<p>“1. There shall be established a central or principal
school, according to the Lancasterian system,
under the direction of Mr. Thomson.</p>

<p>“2. The convent or college of St. Thomas shall
be appropriated to this purpose. The friars at
present residing in it shall remove to the large
convent of St. Dominic, leaving only so many as
are necessary for the service of the church attached
to it.</p>

<p>“3. In this establishment the elementary parts of
education shall be taught, together with the modern
languages. The teachers necessary for this purpose
shall be appointed agreeably to the arrangements
which will be pointed out in the plan
for the National Institute of Peru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“4. At the expiration of six months all the
public schools shall be shut, which are not conducted
according to the system of mutual instruction.</p>

<p>“5. All the masters of the public schools shall
attend the central school with two of their most
advanced pupils, in order to be instructed in the
new system; and in studying it they shall attend
to the method prescribed by the director of the
establishment.</p>

<p>“6. As soon as the director of the central school
shall have instructed a sufficient number of teachers,
these shall be employed, with competent salaries,
in establishing public schools on the same principles
in the capital city of each province of the state.</p>

<p>“7. At the first public examination which shall
take place in the central school, those masters who
have been most attentive in learning the system,
and shall have made such progress as to be able to
conduct schools according to it, shall receive the
reward of a gold medal, to be ordered for that purpose
by the Minister of State.</p>

<p>“8. For the preservation and extension of the new
system the Patriotic Society of Lima is particularly
requested and commissioned to take such measures
as may be considered necessary for these purposes;
and they are desired to make known to the government
those things in which its co-operation may
be required, in order effectually to carry forward
this important object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“9. In order that the advantages of this system
of education may be extended to the female sex,
which the Spanish government has always treated
with culpable neglect, it is particularly recommended
to the Patriotic Society to take into consideration
the most likely means for establishing
a central school for the instruction of girls.</p>

<p>“10. The salary of the director, and the other expenses
necessary for this establishment, shall be
defrayed by the government. The Minister of
State is authorized to issue all the orders necessary
for the punctual fulfilment of this decree.</p>

<p>“Given in the government palace in Lima, 6th
July, 1822.</p>

<p class="center">(Signed)</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Truxillo</span>.</p>

<p class="center">“By order of his Excellency, countersigned,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">B. Monteagudo</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>As we go on in our operations, I shall communicate
to you the result.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 4th September, 1822.</i></p>

<p>The <em>first</em> of September has returned, and has
gone by. I have not, however, failed in seizing
an opportunity of writing you according to our
agreement. You know, I dare say, that we have
not a post that leaves Lima every morning for
England. A vessel goes now and then from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Callao to Valparaiso, and through these two places,
and across the Andes, and through Buenos Aires,
my letters to you are now obliged to travel. No
vessel has sailed for Chile since the 1st current;
but in a few days the French frigate lying here is
to sail for Valparaiso.</p>

<p>I have now been upwards of two months in this
city, and have all the while enjoyed my health very
well. I am inclined to think this climate is better
than I was led to expect from the accounts I had
heard of it. The tertian ague, however, is a disease
very common, especially during summer. Of
the Englishmen I know here, three have had it
since my arrival. The general opinion, I think, is,
that with great regularity of living, this place is
not unhealthy; but that the effects of irregularity
in the general mode of living, is more hurtful here
than in most other places. A good police would
certainly contribute greatly to the healthiness of
this city. This will be enjoyed, I believe, in due
time; but the Government has so many things at
present to do, that some time may elapse before
that improvement takes place. This is the largest
city I have yet seen in South America, and I
believe there is none larger in it. I do not, of
course, include Mexico, which is in North America.
The houses here, and the general appearance
of the city, have a more commanding and richer
aspect than what is met with in Buenos Aires or
Santiago de Chile. The general appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
the population, however, I think, is considerably
inferior to what is seen in these two places, particularly
in the latter. One thing which contributes
to this difference, is the considerable proportion of
slaves here. In Buenos Aires, there are a good
many of this class of our fellow-men, but fewer
than in Lima and Santiago; and in Chile, in general,
there are very few; and this is one thing which
inclines me to prefer the general appearance of
Santiago to the other two cities I have mentioned.</p>

<p>About three weeks after my arrival here, San
Martin set out for Quito, to have an interview with
Bolivar. They met in Guayaquil, as the President
of Colombia had left Quito, and reached that
place before San Martin landed. The interview
was, I dare say, interesting, and I trust it will be
productive of good effects for the two countries of
which they are the Governors, and also for South
America in general. A good understanding, I
trust, will be kept up between the nations of this
continent, and war in it I hope will be a thing
as rare, and rarer than peace has been in Europe.
San Martin returned a few days ago, and has since
re-assumed the reins of Government, as “Protector
of the liberty of Peru.” Every exertion is
making here for the formation of a congress. The
greater part of the representatives are already
elected. All the liberated provinces elect their
own members for congress freely; the right of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
voting is, I believe, much the same as in the
United States. Representatives are chosen for
those provinces still under the dominion of the
Spanish army, from among the inhabitants of those
places at present residing in Lima. A fair representation
seems to be desired and sought for, and
I hope will be attained in a considerable degree.
All acts emanating from such a body will, of
course, give more general satisfaction, than if the
representation were partial. I do not trouble you
with my views of governments, whether monarchical
or republican. Certainly, on this subject, “much
may be said on both sides.” Without fixing my
mind for or against this or that form of government,
I am strongly in the opinion of Pope, where
he says, “Whate’er is best administered is best.”
I do not think, however, that all are fools, (as he
insinuates) who, “for forms of government contest.”
The sum of the matter and the truth is,
that honesty and uprightness are more required,
and have been less found in all governments than
any thing else. Wisdom, therefore, requires, that
such measures should be taken in arranging the
form of government, as may secure good conduct
in governors, in the greatest possible degree.</p>

<p>There were some suspicions, some time ago, and
some flying words, which, if true, would have led
one to suppose that San Martin wished to form
Peru into a monarchy. Who was to be king
according to these reports, I need not inform you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
as I suppose you will find no difficulty in guessing
it at the first trial. The prime minister was of
course in the secret, if there was any such thing
in hand. With this individual, on other grounds,
there was a good deal of dissatisfaction. This
dissatisfaction openly broke out a few weeks ago,
on account of his interfering in the election of
representatives for this city. The consequence was,
that a petition was presented to the Marquis of
Truxillo, requesting that the minister might be
immediately dismissed. This petition was signed
by so many of the respectable and powerful inhabitants
of the place, and presented with such firmness,
that it had the desired effect. The minister
resigned before the petitioners left the palace, and
in a few days after, he was sent off by sea to
Panama. All this took place in San Martin’s
absence, and the leaders in it were the republican
party. San Martin has very wisely fallen in with
these measures since his return, and has confirmed
the new minister in his situation. A republic, I
think, is the general wish of the people, and as
the form of government is to be determined by the
Congress, I have little doubt of what the result
will be.</p>

<p>You know, I dare say, that Colombia is free.
The longest and severest struggle of South America
has been in that quarter. The first news I
heard on casting anchor in Callao, was that Quito
had fallen into the hands of the patriots. I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Bolivar, who has been the chief instrument in the
Colombian contest, is a great man. I was not at
the interview between him and San Martin, that
I might take their comparative dimensions at one
view; but I may observe, that the general opinion,
from a view of the operations of both, is in favour
of the Northern Chief. As far as my own information
and knowledge of each extends, I fall in
with this opinion. I do so, not from any dissatisfaction
with San Martin. He is to me, and has
been uniformly, more than I could have expected,
and I may say, all I could wish. I believe both
of these men are most sincerely desirous of the
real welfare of the countries which they respectively
govern, and of South America. There is
no unholy alliance yet formed in this country, and
I think there never will. On all hands, light and
information are encouraged, sought after, and promoted.
Knowledge, rich with the spoils of time,
has just unrolled her ample page in this city, in a
public library. This public institution is very respectably
got up, and already possesses a number
of the best works in the various branches of
literature. It is inferior to the similar institution
in Buenos Aires; but superior, if we consider
the short reign of civil, literary, and religious
freedom in Peru. Every individual is free to
attend this library every week-day, from 8 to 1,
and from 4 to 6, without expense; and every
book in it is at his command during that time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
This one view of the present state of things here,
shows at once the immense advantages gained
here by the revolution, and the blessings that
tread in the steps of liberty. I shall add one
thing more to confirm what I have just said.
The Bible is now publicly sold at a short distance
from the place where used to sit the dreadful
Inquisition. Perish all unrighteousness from
the earth! May the knowledge and love of God
every where abound!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 9th Nov. 1822.</i></p>

<p>A considerable time has now elapsed since
I last wrote you, and a much longer time has intervened
since I had the pleasure of receiving a letter
from you. Although I have not communicated
with you directly during this time, yet I suppose
you are well acquainted with my various circumstances
in this part of the world, through means of
my letters sent from time to time to my friends in
Edinburgh. Since my leaving my native country,
I have experienced much of the gracious goodness
of our heavenly Father, in directing my steps, in
making darkness light before me, and crooked
things straight. The encouragements I have met
with in my endeavours to forward the Lord’s cause
in South America, have been much greater than
could have been expected before the trial was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
made. I think a door has been opened here which
will never be shut, but which will, I trust, from
one year to another, open wider and wider, until it
become, in the Apostle’s language, “great and
effectual.” Should I say, there are no adversaries,
and that all goes on prosperously, without
any difficulty or discouragement from any quarter,—should
I say this, it would be nearly the same as
telling you, that a great miracle had taken place
here, and had changed the nature of man. You,
of course, expect no such wonderful accounts. At
the same time, it is a gratifying thing to be
able to state, that far less opposition has been
met with than was expected. Difficulties, I believe,
of whatever kind, will grow fewer and
weaker as Time runs on, bearing in his hand the
torch of heavenly light; whilst, on the other hand,
means and opportunities of doing good will greatly
increase. It is surely a gratifying sight to see
darkness fleeing away, and the light of heaven
breaking forth. You know there is no fellowship,
in any sense, between light and darkness, the one
must give place to the other. Wherever, then,
darkness prevails, let the people of God look to
him who said, “Let there be light, and there was
light;” and let them use those means which he has
appointed, under the full assurance, that midnight
shall give place to the dawning light, and that
again to noon day. That a great and happy
change is about to take place in our hitherto unfortunate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
unhappy world, the Scriptures predict;
and the days in which we live say, “Lift up your
heads, for this happy period draweth nigh.” You
who live in the land of Israel, whence the word of
the Lord is sounding out on all sides, see these
things better than I can do in this far distant
country. From every corner of the earth messengers
are daily landing on your happy shores
with tidings of joy. One says, Babylon is fallen;
another cries, the gods of the heathen are famished;
whilst a third shouts aloud, Satan falls
like lightning to the ground. I almost envy this
felicity of yours; yet I would not exchange conditions
with you. Solitary and alone as I am
here, I would not wish myself elsewhere, because
I believe I am placed where God would have me
to be; and, I trust, his work, in one shape or
another, is all my concern. I do, however, wish
myself otherwise circumstanced. I should be glad
to have with me one or more with whom I could
always communicate in the ways and work of the
Lord, and whose counsels and labours might prove
a blessing to me and to many. You, my dear
brother, who dwell in Mount Zion, have never
experienced the disadvantage of being <em>thus</em> alone.
Should I come into your thoughts when you bow
your knees unto the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, I beg you to pray that grace, and
mercy, and peace may be multiplied unto me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and that the Lord’s work may prosper in South
America.</p>

<p>In my letters to Edinburgh since my arrival in
this city, I have stated the favourable reception
I met with here from San Martin, and from others
in the government. Since that time, the state of
affairs here, in regard to politics, has considerably
changed. San Martin has resigned his authority
in all its parts in this country, and is gone to Chile.
The Congress was installed on the 20th September,
into whose hands he delivered all the concerns of the
government, and next morning, at four o’clock, he
set off for Chile. When he took the reins of government
into his own hands, under the title of
“Protector of the Liberty of Peru,” he promised
to resign his authority as soon as a general Congress
could be assembled; and by his resignation
at the time proposed, he justified his sincerity in
the eyes of the world. During the time he was in
power, reports were current that he was desirous to
make himself king of Peru. His conduct, however,
has shown, that these reports were without
foundation. As far as my own affairs here are
concerned, I should have been glad that he had
remained longer in the country, and, if I am not
mistaken, Peru would have been benefited by his
stay. San Martin is an intelligent and liberal-minded
man. He is very desirous of promoting
the progress of South America in knowledge, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
he is free from those prejudices which hinder its
advancement. The Congress has now been assembled
for several weeks, and has been occupied
with various concerns relative to the government of
the country. From their own number they have
chosen three to discharge the duties of the executive
government. This triumvirate is to continue
until a constitution be drawn up, and a new Congress
assembled, composed of representatives chosen
in every province of Peru. This complete representation
of the country cannot be obtained whilst
the Spaniards are in possession of a considerable
part of it, as they actually are at this moment. At
present there is great distress felt here by the government,
for want of money to carry forward the
operations of the war. This appears to be the chief
obstacle in preventing the general independence of
Peru. Troops are not wanting, as, in addition to
those brought by San Martin, and those who have
since been raised in the country, General Bolivar has
sent about 2,000 well-experienced troops from Quito,
as affairs in that part have now been brought to a
favourable conclusion. The English merchants here
have just given the government a loan of 70,000
dollars, by way of helping them out of their difficulties.
An expedition sailed some weeks ago for
Arica, and we anxiously look for the result. All
that part of the country is in possession of the
Spaniards, as well as nearly all the best provinces
of the kingdom. Notwithstanding the possessions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
which Spain still holds in Peru, the independence
of the country is not at all doubtful. It may, indeed,
by the mismanagement of the Congress, or
by some other misfortune, be retarded, but it must
ere long completely prevail. I believe there are
no remains of the Spanish arms now existing in
America, except those in our neighbourhood, and
about 1500 men in the isles of Chiloe. What a
change, in this respect, has taken place within these
few years past! And let not this revolution be
considered as a small matter by the man of benevolence
and the Christian. The interests of religion
and of humanity are very closely connected
with it. That once dreadful, now innoxious house,
the Inquisition, reminds me, as I daily pass it, of
the happy change which has taken place. True it
is, that the Spaniards have now put down the Inquisition
throughout their dominions; still, however,
there are many inquisitorial things yet subsisting
in Spain that do not exist in the independent
states of South America. Every effort has been
used by Spain to retard the progress of knowledge
in America. These days, however, have now gone
by, and light of every kind begins to dawn on
these countries. My own opinion is, that the nations
of South America in a few years will far
outstrip many of the nations of Europe. The
people here, to a certain extent, are conscious of
their ignorance, and are desirous of wiping out that
stain which Spain has left upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>I have hitherto been speaking of the progress of
knowledge in general in South America, and its
probable results. I shall now say something of
the progress making in the knowledge of religion.
You know, of course, that the Roman Catholic
religion is the only religion professed in this
Continent—as it once was the only one in Great
Britain. Many are beginning to see through this
system, and to find out its inconsistencies. I wish
I could also say, that all who see thus far, have
attained to the knowledge of the true religion, as
laid down in the New Testament. This, however,
is not the case. On the contrary, I am sorry to
say, that deistical principles are espoused by the
greater part of those who get out of the trammels
of popery. A good many in the higher ranks,
particularly in the army, are of this way of thinking.
This state of things need not surprise us. It
is perhaps the natural result, or transition, in those
places where no other religion is known than the
one professed in this country. A man begins to see
the absurdity of the Catholic system, and from his
infancy all that is religion with him has been connected
with it. In giving up this system, he gives
up with religion itself, as considering popery and it
the same thing. From these circumstances, I conceive
this to be the most favourable time for introducing,
as far as can be done, the holy religion of
our Lord Jesus Christ. The present is the time for
labouring in this field, by introducing the Scriptures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and by every other means which prudence may
dictate. Prejudice is growing less every day, and
this is the result of the revolution. There is even
a perceptible difference between the different parts
of this Continent in regard to the decrease of prejudice.
In Chile there is less than in Lima, because
it has been longer independent. Again,
there is still less in Buenos Aires than in Chile,
for the same reason. Having mentioned Buenos
Aires, I cannot leave it without eulogizing it, in
almost the highest degree, in regard to the progress
it is making. One reform succeeds another in rapid
succession. They are just about to put a stop to
monachism, and to take the church property into
their own hands, paying the clergy out of the public
treasury. It is said also, that they are about to
pass a law for religious toleration. In every respect
Buenos Aires now holds the first rank among
the cities and countries of South America. To
have one place thus stepping forward by way of
pattern to the rest is of immense advantage. There
are several periodical works of a superior kind
issuing from the presses in that city. In these
every subject is freely discussed, prejudices attacked,
and reforms proposed. The liberty of the
press is enjoyed and acted upon there in the same
manner as it is in England. The articles published
in the Buenos Aires papers and magazines find
their way gradually into the papers of Chile and
Peru, and thus prepare the way in these places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
also for following up, ere long, the same reforms
and arrangements that are now going forward in
the pattern city I have mentioned. In this city,
also, the liberty of the press is enjoyed to a considerable
extent. This, however, only commenced
about two or three months ago, upon the dethronement
of the principal Secretary of State. This
individual, though a great friend to reform himself,
and from whom I met with every encouragement,
wished to keep these things in his own hand, at
least for some time, and to grant the freedom of
the press by degrees. The plan of ecclesiastical
reform published in Buenos Aires was also published
in the public paper of this city. Various
other things of a similar nature are thus indirectly
brought under the consideration of the people of
Peru; and coming from Buenos Aires, they are
better received than they would be, coming from
any part of Europe, especially from a Protestant
country. We had also an attack upon the friars
of Lima the other day, in one of the publications
of this city, whose editor is one of the Secretaries of
Congress. These things you will consider as the
fruits of the revolution in South America; and the
time fast approaches, when we shall see still more
abundant fruits, and those too of the best kind.
The Lord reigneth, let the earth be glad!</p>

<p>With respect to the climate of this place, you
know, we are here fairly within the torrid zone,
the latitude of this city being 12° 2′ 51″ S. A few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
days ago we had the sun vertical here, as he passed
us on his way to the southward. Notwithstanding
our proximity to the equator, we enjoy a very
agreeable temperature. In the winter the sun but
seldom makes his appearance; in spring he shows
himself more frequently; and in summer he throws
off reserve, and from his vertical throne looks down
in all his magnificence. From ten o’clock till two,
it is pretty hot, but about this hour a refreshing
breeze springs up from the south, which is very
agreeable. It is generally said, that it never rains
in Lima. This, however, is not quite correct. It
does rain a very little in the winter season; but the
drops, when they can be recognised as such, seem
to have passed through the finest rain sieve. It
is, in short, rather a kind of mist than rain, although
at times it may be called by the latter
name; and when it is so, the people of Lima call
it a heavy shower. Before I came here I frequently
heard this climate denominated unhealthy.
The tertian ague prevails a good deal, but on the
whole I do not consider this an unhealthy place.
For my own part, I never enjoyed better health
than I have done since my coming to this city.
Blessed be God for this precious blessing!—There
is one thing of a rather terrifying nature to which
this place is subject, I mean earthquakes. There is
no place, I suppose, more subject to them than this
city. We have had several shocks since I came
to it; the greatest was on the 14th September.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
I was awaked at a quarter past three o’clock in
the morning by a <em>most dreadful</em> noise. I was at
no loss to know what this noise was, considering
the part of the world I was in. This noise continued
for a few seconds, and increased. The shock
then followed, and made all the house shake, as if
the whole were coming to the ground. A loud
hollow noise followed this for a few seconds, and
on its ceasing all was tranquil as before it commenced,
and those who had fled out of their houses
quietly returned. These phenomena are of frequent
occurrence. There are, I believe, about
thirty earthquakes here in the course of a year.
Those, however, which throw down houses and
produce other ravages are rare. Once in fifty years
seems to be about the period of those terrible visitations,
and with considerable regularity Lima has
suffered severely at the return of this fatal period.
The city of Quito to the north, and of Arequipa to
the south, have also their periodical visitations.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 2d December, 1822.</i></p>

<p>Some weeks ago a Committee of the Congress
was entrusted to draw up the <em>outlines</em> of a political
constitution for the country. This has been accomplished,
has been presented to Congress, and
ordered to be printed. The Congress is just now
engaged in discussing it, article by article. A good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
deal of interest is thus excited and kept up regarding
the subject, and, in consequence, the Congress-hall
is daily well attended by all classes. The
discussion of the article on the form of government,
and that on religion, have excited the most attention.
The form of government has been unanimously
declared to be republican, agreeably to
what I hinted to you in one of my late letters.—In
“the outlines,” the article on religion runs thus:
“The religion of the state is the Catholic Apostolic
Church of Rome.” One of the members of the
committee wished to add the word <i>only</i> or <i>exclusive</i>,
but the rest not agreeing to it, he entered his protest.
On this account, as well as from the general
interest of the subject, the matter was keenly discussed.
I went, as you may well suppose, to hear
what should be said on both sides, and to see the
result. The first who ascended the tribune to
speak was a clergyman, carrying in his hand a
book about the size of a New Testament. He
began by stating, that it was his sincere desire that
all men might be of the Roman Catholic church.
He then stated that the only proper way, in his
opinion, of bringing men into the church was, not
by force, nor by persecution in any shape, but
solely by persuasion, by the force of reason. After
speaking a few minutes to this effect, he went on to
treat of the article as stated in the “outlines.” He
regretted the divisions among Christians, and the
distinctive names one body and another had taken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
He then opened the book he had in his hand, which
I now found to be one of the Bible Society’s New
Testaments, in Spanish. He read the 12th and
13th verses of the first chapter of the first Epistle
to the Corinthians, and proceeded to make some
remarks upon the passage, and to apply it to the
article in question. It appeared to him, he said,
very like the divisions censured by the Apostle
Paul, to see the article stated in the words, <i>Roman</i>,
<i>Catholic</i>, <i>Apostolic</i>. Having done this, he proposed
that the article should be stated in this manner:—“The
religion of Jesus Christ, is the religion of the
state.” He then made some observations upon the
propriety of stating it in this way, in preference to
the way in which it stands in the outlines, and so
concluded. As might have been expected, this
alteration or amendment was opposed. My memory
is not so faithful as to give you the various
speeches upon the subject, but a great deal was
said on both sides of the question. In particular,
the member of the Committee who had protested,
defended what he had done in a long speech, in
which he paid but little respect and fewer compliments
to us foreigners. He concluded his long
story by saying, that he was so full of matter upon
this subject, and felt so much interest in it, that he
could still speak four whole days upon it. Another
speaker got up with a volume of the Bible in his
hand. He turned to two passages in the law of
Moses, where the children of Israel were admonished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
to deal kindly towards strangers and
foreigners, and concluded by a short comment upon
the passages in reference to the subject in hand.
In a country like this, where all the natives are of
the Roman Catholic Church, every thing that is
said upon toleration has a direct reference to
foreigners, for it is never for a moment supposed
that any of the natives will leave the Roman Catholic
Church to become Protestants. The introduction
of foreigners into the country, and the
consequent advantages and disadvantages of it,
entered deeply into the debate. I shall refer only
to one speech more upon the subject. An aged
member, and a clergyman, rose up and said, “Gentlemen,
this is the first time I have risen to speak
in this house, and it is not my intention to detain
you long. I understand,” said he, “that the grand
and principal features of our religion are these two:—To
love the Lord with all our heart and strength,
and to love our neighbour as ourselves. We must
then take care,” continued he, “that our zeal for
the <em>first</em> of these two commandments does not make
us overlook the <em>second</em>. Now I ask, whether foreigners
residing among us are to be considered
our neighbours or not. If they are, then we ought
to love them. Gentlemen, I have nothing further
to add.” After being fully discussed, the votes
were taken. First, whether the article should
stand as stated in the outlines, or be altered. It
was carried that it should remain as stated. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
next question was, if the word exclusive should be
added, and it was unfortunately carried in the affirmative.
The article now stands thus:—“The
Roman Catholic Apostolic Religion is the religion
of the state, and the exercise of every other is excluded.”</p>

<p>We are not to be surprised that the matter has
ended in this manner; perhaps we should rather
wonder that there was any one of the members of
the Congress disposed to speak, or even to think on
the side of toleration. The members who are
friendly to religious liberty, may amount to one
third of the whole, or, perhaps, somewhat more
than one third, and they are men of influence and
respect in the country. These made a less vigorous
stand for toleration at the present time, from the
consideration that what is done now in regard to
the sanctioning of the basis of the constitution, is
only provisional. The Spaniards, at present, possess
many of the best provinces of Peru, and these
provinces have, strictly speaking, no representatives
in the Congress. The manner of proceeding, in
reference to these provinces, was this:—The natives
of each province, residing in Lima, met and chose
members from among themselves to represent the
province, until such time as the enemy be dislodged,
and they have freedom to choose their own representatives.
As soon then as the country is free,
the present Congress will dissolve itself, and a general
Congress will be immediately elected, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
outlines now under consideration will be presented
to the new Congress to be examined, and, if judged
necessary, altered. There is, therefore, still some
hope, that toleration may have a place in the Peruvian
constitution. During the interval, the press
may forward the good cause, as there is perfect
freedom for speaking and printing any thing upon
the subject, on both sides of the question. We
may, indeed, call this freedom of speaking and
writing upon the subject, a kind of toleration; at
all events, it is a prelude to it.</p>

<p>Pamphlets of every shape, size, and name, are
issued from the press. In these every subject is
handled, and abuses and prejudices are attacked
with freedom and courage. The poor friars are
not overlooked in these; almost every body is
against them, and none seems to rise up in their
defence. One of the members of Congress has
made a motion for the reformation of the Convents.
The bill he is about to bring in, contains four articles.
The first is to allow all those to leave the
Convents who wish to do so. The second is to
allow no one in future to become a friar. The
third is, that the government should take possession
of all their property, and allow them out of it
what is necessary for their support. The fourth
article is, to make them all live in <em>one</em> convent, instead
of occupying <em>fourteen</em>, as they now do. This
you see is a bold proposition, and, if carried into
effect, will be a great step in reformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>At the time the article on religion was under
consideration, a certain individual went about with
a paper containing a petition to Congress, praying
that the Roman Catholic religion might be the
religion of the state, <em>and the only one tolerated in
the country</em>. The last part of the petition was the
object he had in view. He obtained a number of
signatures to the petition, and without loss of time
laid it before the Congress. It was, however, not
allowed to be read, and several were for calling
this individual to account for his officiousness.
This medical gentleman (for he is of that profession)
has been sadly handled in the pamphlets
of the day for this conduct; so much so, I think,
as to keep him from being forward to engage a
second time in such an undertaking. I have already
mentioned how freely all matters are discussed
in these pamphlets. One of them has just
begun to give a history of the Popes. From the specimens
already published, this history promises not to
be very honourable to the personal character of the
Popes, neither does it appear intended to strengthen
their pontifical authority and influence, but quite
the contrary. There was a monthly magazine published
in London, during the despotic reign of the
present Ferdinand. In this work there was given
a history of the Popes, and I believe what is publishing
here just now is copied from the work I
have mentioned. This magazine was called El
Español Constitucional. It was written by one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
those who had fled from Ferdinand’s despotic hands.
He was a liberal man, and writing in London he
felt himself under no restraint in speaking of the
abuse of the Church of Rome. There was
another periodical work in the Spanish language,
published some years before it, called El Español.
This was also printed in London, and was written
with the same liberality and spirit. Both these
works have reached South America, and have been
a good deal read; and, as you may suppose, they
have served considerably to enlighten the people
of these countries.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, in some of my late letters, the
very gratifying circumstances of the rapid sale in
this city of 500 Spanish Bibles, and 500 New
Testaments. These were all sold off in <em>two days</em>,
and as many more could have been sold in the two
days following, but there were no more, and thus
many were disappointed. From this cheering circumstance,
I am daily looking with great anxiety
for a considerable number of both Bibles and
Testaments, expected from the Bible Society. The
above-mentioned circumstance is truly encouraging,
as no desire at all comparable to it, has yet been
manifested in any other part of South America for
the Holy Scriptures. From this, and some other
occurrences, I am led to anticipate that the word
of God will, indeed, have free course in this place,
and let us pray that it may not be circulated only,
but that it may be glorified also. I have another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
thing to relate to you, perhaps more cheering still.
It is this: the nearly confident expectation of
getting the New Testament introduced throughout
Peru as a school book. I trust this expectation
will not be disappointed, but verified in due time.
Every thing promises fair at present for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>As soon as the Bibles got into circulation as
above-mentioned, there was some ferment excited
from reports that it was not fairly printed from the
Spanish version of Scio, as indicated in the title
page. This report was raised, or at least increased,
by the discovery of a typographical error or two.
An honest priest actually burned the Bible he had
bought on the discovery of one of these oversights
in the printing. The consequence of this
stir was an examination of the Bible Society’s
edition, by comparing it with the edition printed in
Spain. The result of this examination was highly
satisfactory, as the London edition was found to be
an exact reprint from the latest Spanish edition,
with the exception of some slight oversights in
passing through the press. About the time this
matter was under consideration, the deputy Archbishop
(for there is no Archbishop here at present)
having learned that a certain priest was likely to
say something from the pulpit against the reading
of the Bibles from London, sent a message to him,
telling him “not to preach any thing against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
reading of the English Bibles.” By English
Bibles he meant Bibles from England, for the
Bibles were in the <em>Spanish</em> language.</p>

<p>A curious little piece, in the poetic form, appeared
about a fortnight ago in one of the newspapers
of this city. There is a great deal of truth
and force in it, and as it is but short, and will not
occupy much room, I shall give you a translation
of it. To do it justice it should be put in poetic
dress, but as you know I am neither poet nor
rhymester, you will please accept of it in plain
prose. “<em>Simon possessed a fishing bark</em>, and just a
fishing bark, nothing more he left to his sons. They
however were great fishers; they caught much and
grew rich, and could no longer be content with their
small bark, but got a larger one. This bark afterwards
became a brig, and then a ship. At last it
grew into a man-of-war, and frightened the world
with its cannon. How wonderfully is this ship of
war now changed! how different now to what it
was in former times! This great ship is now grown
old, and, shattered by the storms it has encountered,
it now lies rotting in the harbour. A
thousand times has it been repaired, but at last it
must be laid aside altogether, and its owners must
once more be content with <em>Simon’s fishing bark</em>.”
You will find no difficulty, I dare say, in applying
this little piece, and, I believe, you will join
with me in wishing that the concluding part may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
be verified as exactly as the preceding parts
have.</p>

<p>There is a great revolution going forward in
South America. I speak not of the revolt from
under the Spanish yoke, for that in the present
day may be said not to be going forward, but accomplished.
The revolution I speak of, is a moral
one. Those who have eyes to see this goodly
prospect, and those who have ears to hear the harmony
of this moral change, meet on every hand
with indications of its approach. You will not
understand me as saying, that South America has
become like the land of Eden, like the garden of
God. No. But a change has been begun, a happy
change. Let us put our hand to this work. Let
us bear it onward, and God Almighty will consummate
it in due time.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 28th January, 1823.</i></p>

<p>A good while has elapsed since I mentioned to
you any particulars of my affairs in reference to
the schools. During this time, however, I have
more than once thrown out hints, signifying that
matters went on but slowly. I had too much
reason for these complaints. The truth is, I was
once and again on the point of leaving this place.
My affairs here have been such, since my arrival,
that I may truly say, my hopes and prospects in
South America never were so high, and never were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
so low as they have been, at different times, in
Lima. I formerly stated to you the very favourable
reception I met with from San Martin, and
from the first Secretary of State, Monteagudo.
Both of these left this place a good while ago,
although under different circumstances. To me
their loss was severely felt. I never mentioned a
wish to San Martin, or to Monteagudo, that was
not granted, and granted immediately in the most
obliging manner. After their going away, I
scarcely mentioned any thing I wished done that
was not refused. I should not, perhaps, say refused,
for I was not actually denied; I was told that
the things I stated would be done, but these promises
were never fulfilled. Had I been plainly
refused, there is every probability that I should
have left this place long ago. After experiencing
a number of delays, and when my little stock of
patience was all gone, I asked for my passport.
The same individual, however, who had so often
put me off with fair promises, contrived to put off
my passport also, and kept me waiting days together,
with every thing nailed up for my departure.
It was then agreed on between us, that since the
school plan we had in view could not be carried
into effect from want of funds, I should stop three
or four weeks to instruct some individuals in the
Lancasterian system. About twelve came, in consequence
of this, to my lodgings once a day, for
the instructions referred to. At the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
time mentioned, these individuals were much pleased
with the new plan, and some of them represented
the matter to the minister, who gladly entered into
it, and it was agreed that I should stop, and that
what was wanting should be granted. I did think
him for this time sincere, and I believe he was so;
but I was again subjected to be put off from week
to week, until I found that I was circumstanced
exactly as before. I petitioned anew for my passport,
and in the mean time wrote a letter to the
Congress, detailing all that had happened from the
time of my arrival in Lima, and concluded by
stating, that I intended to leave this place by the
first vessel that sailed, but that I would return or
send some person instructed in the plan of the
schools, if a desire should be expressed by the
Congress to that effect. The result of this communication
was far beyond my expectation. Upon
my letter being read, a great deal of interest was
taken in this matter, and it was unanimously agreed
to that the school should be commenced as soon as
possible. An order was accordingly issued, that
every thing I wanted to set it agoing should be
immediately granted. When I wrote to the Congress,
I had little thought that they would be disposed
to carry this object forward at the time,
having not long before resolved to use the utmost
economy with the public money, and to carry
nothing forward that was not of an urgent nature.
This resolution was very necessary from the low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
state of the public funds, owing to their limited resources,
and the great expenses of the war. In
consequence of the decree of the Congress in our
favour, I at once gave up thoughts of leaving this
place, and we have been since that time getting on
as fast as can be expected. There is another circumstance
of considerable importance, which has
arisen out of this. The person who brought together
those twelve individuals to be instructed in the
system, as above mentioned, is a very respectable
clergyman. This gentleman has interested himself
much in the matter, and has been named by the
Congress to take an active part in all the arrangements
necessary until a School Society be formed.
I have had much intercourse with this individual,
and have good reason to esteem him highly. We
go hand in hand in our affairs most comfortably.
As this gentleman’s name is now connected with
the schools, and being a clergyman, many prejudices
are thereby removed. This is a matter of no
little importance, as there was a strong idea, (whether
well or ill founded, I cannot tell,) that the
late Secretary, of whom I spoke, was atheistical in
his views. Perhaps his atheism consisted in his making
free with the convents and other church affairs.
However that may be, my being favoured by him
probably excited some prejudices, in addition to
those arising from my being a Protestant. The
counteracting influence, therefore, of my connexion
with my present clerical friend will, I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
no doubt, be greatly advantageous. When I add
to this, that it is through this respectable individual
that I expect the New Testament to be introduced
into the schools, of which I formerly wrote, you
will see that I have great cause for thanksgiving
for the circumstances in which we now stand; and
I am even inclined to believe, from what I have seen,
that our present encouraging prospects have not
been too dearly purchased by all the harassing delays
that we have experienced. We are very
short sighted in all things, and can seldom tell what
string of circumstances may end most favourably.
Hence it is that we are often joyous, when we have
not much real cause for being so; and on the other
hand, we are often sad, when every thing is going
on in the most prosperous manner. How consoling
is the thought, that we are permitted to cast all
our cares upon God; upon him who knows the
end from the beginning, and in whose hands, sooner
or later, every thing must turn out well.</p>

<p>I think I have perceived, during the time I have
been in this place, a greater desire to study the
English language than I have met with in any
other part of South America. I have uniformly
encouraged this desire as much as possible, being
fully persuaded that the knowledge of our language,
and of the excellent works it contains, will contribute
in no inconsiderable degree to the progress
of this country in every point of view. Want of
books suitable for beginners in this language has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
formed a considerable obstacle, as well as the want
of suitable teachers. In order to remove these difficulties
to a certain degree, and to carry forward this
useful object, I some time ago set to work to prepare,
in Spanish, a grammar of the English language.
This is now finished, and nearly all printed. I
have at the same time been getting ready a small
book, consisting of extracts from various authors
in our language, for something of this kind was
equally necessary. This little work is also pretty
far advanced in the printing. In the next place,
in order to carry this object into immediate effect,
I lately published my intention of giving instructions
in the English language, and I now have
twenty-three studying it with me, two of whom are
members of Congress.</p>

<p>Accounts have reached us, that on the 19th November
last, a severe earthquake was experienced
in Chile. The first shock was felt about 11 o’clock
at night, and was preceded by a frightful noise.
During the night, and for several succeeding days, a
number of shocks were felt, less destructive, I believe,
but sufficiently alarming. We have not yet
had full information as to the extent of country
over which these shocks have been experienced,
but from what reports have reached us, it seems to
have extended over the greater part of Chile. The
greatest damage, we understand, has been done in
Valparaiso. In that place several houses have
been thrown down, and all the churches have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
severely injured. Accounts say that more than two
hundred people have perished in Valparaiso alone.
Many are the blessings which Providence has poured
out on Chile, and one would almost think that
earthquakes have been added, by way of giving
to it its due proportion of evil. The same may be
said of this country, which has suffered still more
from this cause than Chile has done. We do not
know <em>the moment</em> we may be visited in this city, by
one of these dreadful calamities which have laid
Lima nearly in ruins at different times. To remind
us of our danger, as it were, we are visited by
small shocks from time to time; a month rarely
elapses without one, and about a week ago we had
two in one day. One would naturally think that
the being continually exposed to these catastrophes
would be productive of some happy moral effects
upon the inhabitants of this place. I am sorry to
say there are no appearances of these good results.
If a comparison were to be instituted between the
people of this place, and those of other parts of
South America, in regard to morals, I am afraid
Lima would appear in the back ground. The most
imminent danger, the most signal judgments, seem
somehow or other to be productive of nothing but
momentary effects on mankind. Wherever this
danger or these judgments are, there the words of
Jesus are verified; “If they believe not Moses
and the prophets, neither would they be persuaded
though one should arise from the dead.” I question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
much if we should, in one sense, find fault with this
disposition of mankind; or shall I say rather with
this arrangement of Providence. It points out to
us, I think, how much happier and more solid effects
may be produced by the wielding of the word of
God, than by wielding the mountains, and casting
them into the sea. <em>The word of God</em> is a <em>fire</em>, and
is a <em>hammer</em>, and nothing shall be able to stand before
it; every thing that opposeth shall be reduced
into ashes or into dust; and these shall be blown
away by the winds, to be seen no more for ever.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 3d March, 1823.</i></p>

<p>I have more than once, my dear friend, within
these few days past, heard the exclamation, “happy
are the countries that enjoy a settled and secure
government.” The truth is, we have just experienced
one of those occurrences which frequently
happen in revolutionary times. I wrote you formerly,
that three individuals of the members of
Congress were exercising the executive power in
this place. From events which have lately occurred,
a general dissatisfaction towards this triumvirate
was felt by the army in the neighbourhood of this
city. The consequence of this was, that the troops
drew near to the walls and shut the gates, sending
at the same time a message to the Congress, requesting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
or rather ordering, a change in the government.
After a good deal of deliberation,
the triumvirate was removed by the Congress.
Another step was yet necessary, as a certain individual
was pointed out as the only person capable
of filling the vacant situation. There was no
alternative in this more than in the other proposition,
as a part of the troops kept their station, as
before mentioned, whilst the rest or the greater
part came into the great square in the centre of the
city. Indeed the public opinion, not of the army
only, but also of the great majority of the people,
seemed clearly expressed in favour of the person
proposed. The individual in question was accordingly
appointed by the Congress as “President of
the Republic of Peru.” This was done on the
first current. The troops have retired, and there
seems to be a general satisfaction with this appointment.
Our President’s name is Don José de la
Riva Aguera.</p>

<p>You will naturally wish to know how our new
President is likely to act regarding the schools, and
other such matters. Respecting what his conduct
will be in these things, I have great confidence. I
have known him, and visited him occasionally
since my arrival in Lima, in consequence of a
letter of introduction to him, with which I was favoured
on my leaving Chile. I have uniformly
found him very obliging, and much interested in
our concerns. In short, he is the very individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
I should have named, had I been asked what person
I wished to have in this high station. I called
on him this afternoon in company with my clerical
friend, whom I formerly mentioned to you. We
were well received, and encouraged to go forward
in our work, with the assurance of his protection
and support.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention to you in my last quarterly
letter, that I had about that time got one added to
the number of my friends. This person is a very
respectable clergyman, and a member of the Congress.
We have had several conversations together,
in a very open and friendly manner. I have been
much pleased with his candour and frankness. He
told me that when he first heard of my having come
to Lima, he resolved to oppose me, but that when
he learned that I was not an opposer of religion,
but a friend to it, he changed his mind, and resolved
to befriend me as far as lay in his power.
There is a kind of idea among several of those who
are the most religious in this country, that many or
most foreigners who arrive here are deists or atheists,
or at least men no way friendly to religion.
Grounds have, no doubt, been given for forming
this opinion, although I think it is generalized
among the class of people I mentioned, with some
degree of illiberality, as is, indeed, commonly the
case. The books which come here in favour of
deism and atheism strengthen the opinion. Most
of these are printed in France, but some of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
I am sorry to say it, are printed in England. From
all I have seen here, both in the Congress, and out
of it, I am strongly inclined to think that those
who oppose toleration, or at least many of them,
do so with a view to prevent the influx into the
country of such as oppose or scoff at religion.
As a proof of this, I refer to the member of Congress,
of whom I have just been speaking. This
man opposed toleration when it was discussed in the
Congress, and spoke publicly against it; yet when
conversing with him upon the subject, he told me
that he was not opposed to the toleration of Protestants
in the country. I have taken occasion at
different times to point out to some of the members,
in private conversation, that their law prohibiting
the public religious exercises of those who differ
from the Catholic church, does not hinder atheists
and deists from settling in the country, as these
have no form of religion they wish to practise;
and that this law serves only to prevent the coming
of those men who are sincerely religious and moral,
and who, as they themselves admit, would be of
great use in the country, by bringing into it many
branches of the arts and manufactures. I think I
have observed some good effects arising from these
conversations, and I wish it may so appear when,
the subject comes before Congress a second time.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 26th May, 1823.</i></p>

<p>A considerable time has now elapsed since
I last wrote you. I confess I have acted wrong
in delaying so long; but I know that yourself and
the Committee of the British and Foreign School
Society are ready to forgive. The truth is, I have
had no heart to write you; I have had nothing encouraging
to communicate; and I am never fond
of being a messenger of evil tidings. I have been
bandied about these many months past, without
being able to make any progress in those highly
important affairs in which you feel so deeply
interested. I have been more than once on the
eve of leaving this part of South America, but one
little encouragement or another called me back
just as I was going to embark, and flattered me
into a belief that all would go on well. I shall not
detain you with a long list of grievances, but shall
pass at once to the more pleasing task of calling on
you to join with me in thanksgiving unto Him who
comforteth those that are cast down, and who hath
turned my darkness into light. Blessed be his
name, the prospects of something being done in this
place brighten daily, and I hope yet to communicate
to you something gladdening from the land
of the Incas.</p>

<p>We have, at length, got our school fairly begun,
and under very favourable auspices. I formerly
mentioned to you that the government had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
us for our schools, the College belonging to the
Dominican Friars. The whole of the edifice is at
our disposal for school objects. We have fitted up
for our present school-room, a large apartment,
formerly the college dining-room, which will contain
300 children. The number attending at
present is upwards of a hundred; and we intend
to increase it gradually rather than rapidly,
as we might do were we inclined. The experience
I have had has taught me the necessity of this. It
is an easy matter to tell what the system is, and to
say things are to be managed in such and such a
way; but the great difficulty consists in reducing
it to practice, in training the children to method.</p>

<p>The Congress and the Government here are decidedly
in favour of education. Their object is not
merely the education of the few, but the education
of the many, namely, of every individual in Peru.
The attention of the Congress is, at present, engaged
in drawing up a constitution for the nation.
One of the articles already sanctioned is, that no
one can vote for a member of Congress unless he can
read and write. From the consideration, however,
of the shameful neglect of the Spaniards in promoting
education in the country, these literary
qualifications are not to be exacted until the year
1840. Time is thus given for every individual to
qualify himself in these matters; and the anxious
desire of the Congress is, I am fully persuaded, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
carry forward education with all possible rapidity.</p>

<p>You are aware, I suppose, that the inhabitants
of Peru do not all speak the Spanish language.
The descendants of the ancient Peruvians are very
numerous, and most of them speak the language
of their ancestors. In some parts of the country
they have assumed the manners and the language of
their conquerors and oppressors; but in other parts,
and these by far the most populous, their ancient
tongue is their only medium of communication. I
have long had my eye on this interesting part of
the population of this country. I have, at length,
obtained a fair prospect of being able to plant
schools among them, and also to hand to them the
word of God in their native tongue. An officer
belonging to a regiment, called the Peruvian
Legion, and who thoroughly understands the
<i>Quichua</i>, or Peruvian, language, has taken a great
liking to our system, and is extremely desirous of
benefiting his countrymen by communicating instruction
to them. He is, at present, attending our
school for this purpose, and I entertain a pleasing
hope regarding the future results of his operations.</p>

<p>I beg you to express to your Committee my sincere
respect and gratitude for the very obliging manner
in which they have come forward in aid of the
great work of education in South America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Truxillo, 15th July, 1823.</i></p>

<p>When I wrote my last letter to Mr. S. I
little thought my next letter would be written in
this place. Such, however, is the case, and I
proceed to mention the circumstances that have
brought me here. It is probable that what
has lately taken place in Lima will reach your
ears some days before this comes into your hand.
The Spanish army entered that city on the 18th
ultimo, the Government, the Congress, and a
great number of the inhabitants having left it on
the preceding day. You will wonder at this, I
dare say, after the favourable account of our affairs
in my last letter. It has also been a subject of
wonder unto us all, and of consternation to
not a few. I mentioned in my last, that the
Spaniards had collected a considerable force in
Jauja. They had left Arequipa, and collected
in Jauja with the intention of coming down upon
Lima. They had made this movement when the
independent army was sadly crippled, and when
there was no efficient force to oppose their taking
possession of the capital. When, however, reinforcements
had arrived from Colombia, and an expedition
had been sent off to Arequipa, we little thought
they would persevere in their intention of attacking
Lima. On the contrary, we thought they would
immediately retrace their steps with all speed
towards Arequipa or Cuzco, to secure to themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the possession of these valuable provinces.
The event, however, has turned out otherwise,
and we now understand that they were badly
informed as to the real state of their opponents.
The Spaniards crossed the Andes, and came down
towards Lima in a very rapid and unexpected
manner, with a force of seven thousand well disciplined
men. Upon their presenting themselves
in the neighbourhood of the city, they were reconnoitred
by the Independent Generals, and as
soon as the number and discipline of the Spanish
army were known, it was judged imprudent to
risk a battle with them, as the patriot army is but
about five thousand strong, and many of them recruits.
The independent army considered it most
advisable not only to avoid a general battle, but
also to avoid defending Lima, and chose to retire
to the forts in Callao. The Government and the
Congress, together with a great number of the
principal inhabitants, retired at the same time to
Callao. A few days after, the President and
Congress judged it most suitable to remove from
the scene of military operations, and to take up
a temporary residence in this city. They accordingly
sailed for this place, and arrived about a
fortnight ago.</p>

<p>We were going on with our schools in a prosperous
way on the 16th (June) when the reports of
the rapid approach of the enemy, and the general
confusion throughout the city, induced us to suspend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
our operations on that day for a week, till
we should see what would take place. It was
on that day quite uncertain whether the city would
be defended, (for it is surrounded by a good wall,)
or whether the army would retire from the city
to Callao. On the following day, however, all
doubt on these points was removed, as it was
agreed in a council of war to abandon the city,
and the army accordingly left it on the same day. At
three o’clock I left Lima and went down to Callao,
being assured that the enemy would enter the city
that night, or at all events on the following day.
I slept that night (the 17th) on board of an English
vessel, lying in the harbour. It was my intention
to return to Lima in four or five days, in which
time I supposed the Spaniards would be in quiet
possession of the place, and that order would be again
restored, so that as an Englishman I might pass to
Lima with a passport from the English Commodore
on the station. I accordingly remained some days,
on board the vessel, but there was no possibility of
passing from Callao to Lima with any safety during
that time. On the 20th the vessel I was in cleared
out for the port of Casma, about 200 miles
to the north of Lima, and I conceived it most advisable
to go along with her, as there was no
prospect of re-entering Lima for some time. I
therefore supplied myself with some dollars from
a friend, as I had left Lima without money, and with
scarcely any other clothes than those I had on. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
two days we arrived safely in the port of Casma, and
on the day after our arrival I went up to the village,
which is about 8 miles distant. I was accompanied
from Callao by an old friend, a priest, and a prebendary
of the cathedral of Lima. We made ourselves
acquainted with the Vicar, and were most
hospitably lodged in his house. Here we staid a
week. During this time the accounts from Lima
continued as unfavourable as before, and numbers
of people who had fled from it were arriving at
Casma, and others coming on towards it. I resolved,
therefore, to come on to this city, where
I arrived safely after four days travel through roads
of burning sand, which were very fatiguing to our
horses and to ourselves. The roads all along the
coast of Peru are of this description. Here and
there, at distances of from twenty to forty miles,
there is a river, and in the valley through which
it runs, vegetation of every kind shoots out
luxuriantly, and nothing is wanting but hands
of industry to raise cotton, sugar, coffee, and
all the tropical fruits. My friend, the prebendary,
remained in Casma, but I was accompanied
to this place by two other emigrants from Lima,
and on our arrival here we found not less than
a thousand people of all conditions under similar
circumstances with ourselves. Numbers have since
arrived, and reports say that nearly ten thousand
have left Lima, some having gone to one place and
some to another. Notwithstanding these unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
circumstances, we expect all to return
to the capital before long; it may, however, be
three or four months.</p>

<p>From what has been stated, you may perhaps
think that the cause of independence here is losing
ground fast, or that it is in a hopeless condition.
This, however, is not the case. The Spaniards
will, I believe, be under the necessity of leaving Lima
in the course of a very few months; and in the
mean time they have lost the valuable province of
Arequipa, as there are accounts of the safe arrival of
the expedition which sailed some time ago for that
quarter, and of some advantages they have already
gained, and also of the speedy prospect of taking
possession of all that place, the Spanish force
there being but small. The independent army
will probably march on towards Cuzco, where
the Viceroy is stationed with a force of about
3,000 men, and the ancient capital of the Incas
may very soon become the scene of the contest for
liberty—the contest of truth and freedom, with
ignorance and oppression; and may the righteous
cause prevail.</p>

<p>I have long had a great desire of visiting some
of the interior parts of this country, and present
circumstances offer a favourable opportunity. I
intend, in a day or two, to leave this city for Caxamarca,
and from thence I purpose to go to Jaen
de Bracamoros. If the accounts I there obtain
are favourable, I shall go down the great river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Marañon or Amazon, as far as the mouth of the
Huallága or the Ucayáli. I may then perhaps ascend
some of the rivers which fall into the Marañon
from the north, and go on in this way towards
Quito. If I should be able to get on so far, I
shall then descend from Quito to Guayaquil, and
from thence by sea to Callao. I have got leave
of absence for four months, and have obtained a
letter of recommendation from the President to
the governors of those places through which I
intend to pass. I trust this journey is undertaken
with the same views which induced me to leave
my native country. I trust the Lord will protect
me from every evil, will surround me with his
almighty arm, and will guide and comfort me by
his Spirit.</p>

<p>P.S.—<i>21st July, 1823.</i>——On the day after
writing the above, some accounts reached this
place that the Spanish army was beginning to
retreat from Lima. In consequence of this, I
deferred my journey until certain accounts upon
this subject should arrive. These accounts have
now been fully confirmed. The Spaniards began
their retreat on the 8th current, and the
last division of their army was to leave Lima
on the evening of the 16th, or on the day following.</p>

<p>As Lima is now open, from the retiring of the
Spaniards, I have given up for the present my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
journey to the river Amazon, and to-morrow I
set out for Lima overland.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday the Congress was dissolved
here, and a Senate has been appointed in
its stead.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 8th August, 1823.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to you was dated 9th November
last, and which I hope came safely into your
hands. Though the interval between my letters to
you be considerable, yet I always suppose you
acquainted with what occurs to me here during these
intervals, through my letters to our mutual friends
in Edinburgh. I therefore consider it unnecessary
to go over all that has happened here since I
last wrote to you, and shall confine myself to what
is going forward at the present time. I am sorry
that I have so much to say that may be called of
an unfavourable nature. In my letter to Mr. H.
from Truxillo, I stated the cause of my removal
to that city, and also the favourable change
which had induced me to return. I arrived
safely in this place on the 2d instant, after an
absence of nearly seven weeks. I found, on my
return, all that I had left behind safe, nothing
had been touched. The Spanish army continued
in possession of Lima just twenty-eight days,
during which they did considerable injury to the
place, by levying contributions, confiscating property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
&amp;c. The amount of the loss sustained, in
one shape and another, is reckoned at two millions
of dollars. All the property belonging to the
English merchants, which was in their own warehouses,
was respected, and no loss was sustained
thereon. What goods they had in the Custom-house
they were allowed to withdraw, upon paying
a duty of forty per-cent. The other goods in the
Custom-house, belonging to the natives of the
country, were confiscated and sold on the spot.
The favour thus experienced by the English, was
owing to the intervention of the British Naval Commander
in this place. The Spanish General, however,
intimated to the English merchants that although
he had respected their property at this
time, yet in future he would not do so, but would
confiscate all that belonged to them, should he
return again to Lima, and that thus they might
consider themselves as warned beforehand, of what
they might expect. I had heard in Truxillo
that the Spaniards had destroyed the palace, the
mint, and some other public buildings. This, however,
I am happy to find, was incorrect: they have
destroyed no buildings. The machinery of the
mint was destroyed; and they have carried
off or destroyed all the printing-presses and
types they could lay their hands on. The government
printing-presses and types have escaped, as
they had been removed to Callao in good time.
One or two presses also, belonging to private individuals,
have likewise been saved, having been hid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
at the time the rest were carried off. I suppose
you have read (and correctly too,) in the descriptions
of this city, that the churches are immensely
rich in silver. This, however, is not the case at present,
I assure you. They are now completely stripped
of all their former grandeur in that respect. The
independent government at different times ordered
considerable quantities of the silver in the churches
to be taken to the mint, which was accordingly
done. Upon their retreat from the city on the
approach of the enemy, a few weeks ago, nearly
every thing of silver that could be well spared from
the churches, was carried to the castle in Callao,
to prevent its falling into the hands of the Spaniards.
This proved a proper foresight, for the enemy took
almost every thing that had been left in the churches,
and thus thoroughly stripped them. A priest observed
to me the other day, that it should seem the time
is now come when God chooses to be served with
less splendour, and with more humility. The observation
was good; and I wish the time were indeed
come when the supporters of this system would
lay aside their own riches and righteousness in
every respect, and would clothe themselves with
the righteousness of Christ, and with true humility.
That period is, I trust, advancing, although perhaps
not so fast as we could wish. The Lord, however,
will bring it about in due time. The way we
generally wish to do things, in our impatience, is
to jump to our object; or in other words, to gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
our benevolent ends all at once. This, however,
is not the way the Almighty has established matters
in the depth of his wisdom. The end, he tells
us, may be gained, yea, and shall be gained, but it
can be gained only by the use of the appointed
means, and by patient continuance in well doing.</p>

<p>The Spanish army has marched towards Arequipa
along the coast. The first division under
General Valdes is already at some distance, but
the second division, under Canterác the Commander
in chief, is only about 100 miles to the south of
us. There is, however, I believe, little danger
at present of his returning to Lima, as the main
object of the Spaniards is to attack as early as
possible the patriot army in Arequipa. That
army is now of considerable strength, and much
better equipped every way than the former one
in that place, which was so completely defeated
by the Spaniards at Moquegua. I wish the result
may be favourable to the independent cause, as
much certainly depends on the result.</p>

<p>I mentioned in my letter to Mr. H. that
the Congress had been dissolved in Truxillo, and
that a Senate had been appointed in its place.
This was the single act of the President, and it
was certainly a very bold and imprudent step, not
to say any thing of its injustice. The President
has not yet returned to Lima, and in the mean
time a strong opposition has been stirred up against
him here for having dissolved the Congress. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
representatives now in Lima have solemnly protested
against this measure, have re-installed themselves
as the supreme council and government
of the nation, and have elected the Marquis of
Truxillo to exercise the executive power. What
will be the result of these operations I know not.
It is probable, I think, that Riva Aguera, the President,
will give in, and be banished from the country
for some time, it is certainly a very unfavourable
time for internal disputes. A short time, I
hope, will make all things wear a more smiling
aspect, and may the Lord who reigneth in the
earth, grant that this may indeed be our case. All
things are in his hand. He ever reigneth, although
his benignant hand may at times be invisible to
us.</p>

<p>During the time I was at Truxillo, I formed the
plan of visiting some of the aboriginal inhabitants
of America, on the banks of the river Amazon. I
had calculated that the Spaniards would keep possession
of this city for about three months, and I
supposed, that time would about suffice me for my
intended tour. I had bought a number of glittering
buttons, needles, scissors, knives, fish-hooks,
ribbons, &amp;c., for presents to the natives. I had
also taken out my passport, and was arranging for
setting out, when accounts reached Truxillo, that
a part of the Spanish army had evacuated this city.
In consequence of this, I put off my intended journey,
though with regret, in order to return to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
duties in this place. I have long had a desire to
visit those parts, and though I have not been able
to effect my object at this time, my purpose is not
laid aside, but only postponed until a more favourable
opportunity occur; and in the mean time I
will go on collecting all the information I can, regarding
those quarters. I have a considerable desire
to spend the greater part of my remaining days
on the banks of that great river, or on the borders
of some of its tributary streams. In the Mercurio
Peruano, a work of which I dare say you have
heard, there are some very interesting accounts of
the entrance of the Jesuits and of the Franciscan
Friars into that part of the country. Their success
was various. Numbers of the missionaries
lost their lives in prosecution of their object,
through the cruel hands of those whom they went
to instruct. At length the missions in those parts
made some progress, but they never were very
flourishing; and even in their best state, missions
under such a system were open to many objections.
One single Moravian village in the midst of some
wilderness would be a more gratifying sight than
all the Jesuit missions put together. Though we
may thus condemn their system, because truth requires
it, yet the Missionaries themselves, generally
speaking, in point of zeal and devotion to their
object, are worthy of great commendation, and in
many instances their conduct forcibly attracts our
admiration. The accounts they have published are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
extremely interesting. In another point of view,
also, the Missionaries have done a great service,
by their study of the original languages, and by
the grammars and dictionaries of these which they
published. The whole of these works are by the
Jesuits, and not a volume has been published
since their fall. These grammars and dictionaries
are now extremely scarce in this place. It has
cost me a great deal of labour to obtain some of
them, and others I have not yet been able to
procure, but hope in time to get a copy of all
their writings on those subjects, as well as of the
geographical works they have published.</p>

<p>I believe it is not generally known in Europe
that a great part, the majority of the inhabitants
of Peru, are of the descendants of the ancient
Peruvians under the Incas. An idea is, I believe,
pretty general with you, that the Spaniards nearly
exterminated this race, as they did the inhabitants
of St. Domingo and Cuba. That they destroyed
vast numbers of the indigenous inhabitants of this
part of the world is, alas! too true; still, however,
the majority here are Peruvians, and not Spaniards.
There are, of course, a good many of a
mixed race, and on the coast there are not a few
of the sons and daughters of unhappy Africa, and
their descendants. The Peruvians who live in the
towns on the coast, all speak the Spanish language,
and know nothing of the ancient language of Peru,
called the Quichua. Between the coast and the ridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of the Andes, called the Cordillera, there are many
towns, the inhabitants of which generally speak
the Quichua and the Spanish, with, however, a
predilection for their own native tongue. On the
east of the Cordillera of the Andes, the Spanish language
is but little spoken, and both Peruvians and
Spaniards speak the Quichua. It is spoken, of
course, with more or less purity, in these different
places, a circumstance to be fully expected of an
unwritten language, and among an uneducated
people. I have had my attention turned to those
parts of this country where the Quichua language
is spoken ever since I came to Peru. I have had
a great desire to communicate, in one way or another,
to this ancient people, the blessings of education
and the light of the Sacred Word. The
Spaniards have kept them in the lowest state of
mental existence, and it may be truly said, that
under the Incas, the Peruvians were less ignorant,
and more virtuous, than they are at this day.
At the time the Spaniards (these enemies of knowledge)
drove us from our post here, on their entrance
into Lima, we had in our school two descendants
of the ancient Peruvians studying our
system, with a view to carry instruction among
their countrymen; whilst another of the same people
was actually engaged in translating one of the
Gospels into the Quichua language. I hope we
shall be able to muster our forces again, and to
go on in this good work. Pray for us that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
blessing of the Almighty may be upon us, to crown
us with speedy and certain success.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 1st September, 1823.</i></p>

<p>I mentioned in a former letter, that the members
of the Congress who were in Lima had united
and re-installed this assembly. Their number
daily increased, by the arrival of those who had
fled to various quarters upon the arrival of the
Spaniards. Riva Aguera was left in Truxillo with
a very few only of those he had chosen for his
senate. The public opinion in favour of the Congress,
is very strong, and all seem to rejoice in
its restoration.</p>

<p>Several accounts have reached us of advantages
gained by the patriot troops in the south, but the
good effects of these upon us are greatly lessened
by the continual dread we are in of the operations
of Riva Aguera, who has got collected together
about 3,000 men. Fulminations by the Congress
have been issued against him, calling him tyrant,
&amp;c. &amp;c. and exhorting every good patriot to use
his endeavours to bring him to this city, dead or
alive.</p>

<p>This commencement of internal war is looked
upon by all who feel an interest in the independence
of the country, as a very unfortunate circumstance.
A powerful enemy is at hand, and
ready to seize every opportunity which such divisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
may occasion, in order to subject the country
to its former state. In fact we were, about
a fortnight ago, in great alarm for some days,
from a rumour of the return of the Spanish army.
A happy circumstance, however, has this day taken
place, which will, I trust, unite all parties in one.
This fortunate circumstance is the safe arrival of
Bolivar. He landed this morning in Callao, and
entered Lima this afternoon, to the very great satisfaction
of all. He has brought with him upwards
of 2,000 men, and more it is said are to
follow. The general aspect of the war is now greatly
in our favour, and I think the Spanish army is
rather critically placed. Some letters have been
intercepted from one of the Spanish Generals to
La Serna, giving rather a sad account of his
situation, and mentioning some of his officers of
whose loyalty he had not great confidence. From
all these circumstances, I trust the time is not far
distant when this unhappy and destructive war
will give way to peace and to liberty.</p>

<p>When in Truxillo, I made some arrangements
for the circulation of the Scriptures in that quarter.
There is a medical gentleman there, a native of
Ireland, of the name of O’Donovan. He is of
the Roman Catholic religion, but he has none of
those prejudices against the Bible which many
of the Catholics have. So far is he from being
prejudiced upon this point, that he takes a very
great interest in its circulation, and recommends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
it strongly to all his friends. This is a very happy
circumstance, and I hope the results will be truly
beneficial. Being a Roman Catholic himself,
what he says upon this subject has more weight
than the same things would have from a Protestant.
Since my return to Lima, I have sent
him 50 Spanish New Testaments, and a number
of Spanish tracts, which I got some time
ago. He mentioned to me the effects produced
by some tracts which he formerly had. He
said he gave a few of them to his neighbours,
and some time after inquired how they liked them.
Some of them told him plainly that they did not
like them at all, and that these tracts were not
<em>the Gospel</em>, because there was nothing said about
<em>the Sacraments</em> in them. You would not, he
replied, have the Sacraments spoken of <em>every
where</em>, and nothing but the Sacraments? Let
me read, continued he, a chapter of one of the
Gospels to you. He then took his New Testament,
and read to them accordingly a chapter from
one of the Gospels. Now, said he, is there any
thing about the Sacraments in what I have just
read to you? They said there was not. And is
not <em>this</em> the Gospel, said he? They agreed that
it was. Well then, he continued, may not these
tracts be Gospel too, although there is nothing
of the Sacraments in them. I trust the Lord will
bless the exertions of this worthy individual to
circulate the knowledge of God around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 25th November, 1823.</i></p>

<p>What a cheering thought it is, to contemplate
the glorious exertions of the present day, to put the
Sacred Scriptures into the hands of <em>all</em>. The
names of barbarian, Scythian, bond and free, have
disappeared in the distribution of this noble charity;
and the only distinction known is, those who
have this volume, and those who have it not. The
present mighty efforts bid fair to make this only
distinction among mankind disappear also; and
may it be soon fulfilled; thus leaving every soul in
possession of that treasure which can alone make
his soul valuable.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that something has already been
done here, and that the prospects for the future
are encouraging. Perhaps there have been circulated,
during these few years past, about one
thousand copies of the whole Bible, in the Spanish
language, and considerably upwards of that number
of New Testaments, in the same tongue. It is
true, this is but a small number among so many;
yet it is a good beginning; and you know we
ought not to despise small things, but receive them
with thanksgiving, and as encouragements to perseverance.</p>

<p>Immediately after the rapid sale of the 500
Spanish Bibles, and 500 New Testaments in this
city, as mentioned in my letter of October 18th,
I wrote to London for a large supply, although I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
was then in daily expectation of some arriving.
The supplies sent by the British and Foreign Bible
Society, and which I was then expecting, arrived,
as I afterward learned, in Buenos Aires and in
Chile, but none of them reached this place. I remained
for a long time in great anxiety about the
arrival of a supply for this city, and country adjacent.
After waiting for several months, I received a
letter from the Society, informing me that the whole
edition of the Bible had been disposed of, but that
5000 New Testaments would be sent me as soon as
they could be bound. These have not yet arrived,
but I am in hourly expectation of them.</p>

<p>I come now to speak of a new translation of
the New Testament, which I am endeavouring to
procure in this place. I suppose you are aware that
the greater part of the inhabitants of Peru are the
descendants of the ancient Peruvians. The language
spoken by the Peruvian nation in the time of the
Incas is called the Quichua; and this language,
with some variation, continues to be spoken to the
present day by two-thirds of the inhabitants of this
country. Since my arrival in Peru, I have been
desirous of procuring a translation of a part or the
whole of the New Testament into this language.
I have, at length, got it begun, and under favourable
circumstances. Two of the Gospels, the
Acts of the Apostles, and the two Epistles of
Peter, are already translated into this ancient
tongue. The translation of the rest of the New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Testament is going forward, while the parts I have
mentioned are a revising by four gentlemen, who
have cheerfully offered to take this labour upon them.
I am much pleased to see the interest these individuals
take in this matter; and it will, as it
were, authorize this translation, when it is considered
that they have revised it. All the four are
members of Congress, and one of them is a clergyman.
The gentleman who is engaged in the
translation is a descendant of one of the Incas, or
kings of Peru, and a native of the city of Cuzco.
As soon as the parts I have mentioned are thoroughly
revised, I intend to print them at the expense
of the British and Foreign Bible Society.
In the mean time, the translation of the whole
New Testament will go forward until it is completed.
I am also desirous of beginning with the
Old Testament as soon as the New is translated.
This translation of the whole Bible, and the printing
of an edition of two or three thousand copies,
will cost a considerable sum, especially as printing
is expensive in this country. I have written to
the British and Foreign Bible Society, requesting
their instructions regarding the extent to which they
might wish me to go in this matter at their expense.
I trust they will authorize me to go forward in this
work, and to carry it into completion. As this, however,
is an <em>American</em> work, I believe the American
Bible Society would gladly come forward with
their aid to carry it into effect. This language is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
spoken by about a million of people; and no other
inducement should be necessary to interest Bible
Societies in regard to it. There are also two other
languages spoken in this country, namely, the Aimará
and the Moxa.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> About four hundred thousand
people speak these two languages. I am desirous
of getting, at least, one of the Gospels translated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
into each of these, but have not yet got any thing
done. It is my intention to take a journey through
the interior of Peru; and, when passing through the
places where these two languages are spoken, I
shall endeavour to procure the translations when on
the spot.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, the Lord’s work goes forward,
even in this remote corner. South America has
hitherto been a neglected and benighted country;
but thanks be to God, this long night of darkness
is now far spent, and the day is at hand. From
the time I set my foot on board on my voyage to
South America, I have considered myself as an
American. Ever since that day the interests of
America are the uppermost in my heart. You too,
my dear Sir, and the members of your Society,
are Americans. I would, therefore, call upon you,
as my fellow-citizens, and would rouse you up to the
mighty importance of that sacred work in which
you are engaged. America, North and South, is
the field for your operations. Lo! the poor Indian,
begging from you the “bread of life.” Can
you shut up your bowels of compassion?—“Come
over and help us,” breaks upon our ears from every
quarter. Surely this is not the time to sit down
with folded hands, to rejoice in what has been accomplished.
No. It is the time to blush, and to be
ashamed for our past supineness: it is the time for
calling forth all our energy, for plying every
nerve, in order to make the Light of Life shine
from one end of the earth to the other.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Although I resided upwards of two years in Peru, yet
during that time I did not meet with any person qualified to
translate the Scriptures into either of these two languages.
But after leaving that country, I met with a person fitted for
translating into the Aimará, in a place where I little expected
to find one. In London, last year, when in one of the Paddington
coaches, I perceived that one of my fellow passengers was a
foreigner, from his countenance and manner of speaking.
After we had conversed a little with each other, I took the
liberty to ask him from what part of the world he came. He
told me he was from South America; and upon inquiring
more particularly, I found he was a native of La Paz, in Peru,
the very spot where the Aimará language is spoken. This individual
I found to be perfectly acquainted with this language,
having spoken it from his infancy; and from his education
and other circumstances, I conceived him to be a suitable
person for translating the Scriptures into that language. Our
acquaintance increased, and led to his being engaged by the
British and Foreign Bible Society to translate the New Testament
into his native tongue; and he has now nearly completed
this work.</p>

<p>We call a meeting of this kind accidental, and it was truly
so, in the common sense of the term. But the Christian looks
higher, and finds the directing hand of God in such matters.
What adds to the interest of this circumstance is, that besides
the person mentioned, there is not an individual in England
who understands a word of the language referred to.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 1st December, 1823.</i></p>

<p>I mentioned to you in my last, that Bolivar
had safely arrived in this city. Some days after
his arrival, I was introduced to him, and was
very favourably received. He is, in appearance,
a very modest unassuming man, as far as I can
judge from the short conversation we had together.
He appears very active and intelligent, but I could
not read any thing of an extraordinary nature in
his countenance. He has not the eye of San
Martin, whose glance would pierce you through
in a moment. Bolivar’s weather-beaten face tells
you that he has not been idle. No man, I believe,
has borne so much of the burden, or has toiled
so hard in the heat of the day, in the cause of South
American Independence, as Bolivar. His labours
in his own country are already crowned with nearly
complete success; Colombia may be considered
free and independent. According to all the accounts
which reach us, the Congress of that country
is going on with great steadiness. The following,
I conceive, is a very pleasing trait in
Bolivar’s character. When invited to come here,
he replied, that he would very gladly come without
a moment’s delay, but that he could not allow
himself to obey his feelings in the matter,
as an article of the constitution of Colombia prohibits
the President from going out of the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
without leave from the Congress. From this circumstance,
he said, and from a desire to give an
example of subjection to the laws, he could not
come until he should obtain leave. He accordingly
wrote to the Congress for permission, and
although, from the distance of the capital, he
was long in receiving an answer, and in the interval
was urgently solicited from this quarter,
yet he remained in Guayaquil until the permission
from the Congress came, and immediately after
sailed for this place. Since his arrival here, he
has been chiefly occupied in military occupations,
and in endeavouring to make an accommodation
between the Congress and Riva Aguera. Every
thing has been done by him in this matter, and
I am sorry to say without effect. The last remedy
only remains, and it has been resorted to;
Bolivar in person and 6,000 men have gone
against him. I am told he is pretty confident
of reducing him in a very short time, and that he
expects to return in three or four weeks.</p>

<p>Lima is no longer that city of wealth it formerly
was. The number of people who have been reduced
from tolerably comfortable circumstances
to poverty, is not a few. The affairs of our school
suffer greatly from the present state of this place.
The Government is very friendly towards us, and
very desirous of giving us succour, but they cannot
do all they wish, as this war rivets the attention
of all, and devours all the resources. But
the Lord reigneth, and all shall yet be well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>The Congress has, for some months past, been
busily occupied in framing a constitution for
Peru, and which they have now brought to a
close. A few days ago it was published, and it
has since been sworn to with great formality by
the members of Congress, the Members of Government,
and other public functionaries. It is
very probable that this constitution will be translated
into English, and published in London.
You will, in that case, have an opportunity of
seeing it, and of forming your opinion regarding
its merits. When you have passed your judgment
upon it, I shall be obliged to you to state
particularly what that judgment is, in order that
I may inform my friends here of the result. In
this manner you may perhaps contribute to its
improvement afterwards, as the opinions of foreigners
upon the subject will, I am persuaded,
have some weight. To find a perfect constitution
would be as difficult, perhaps, as to find a perfect
man. The political constitutions of most countries
might be altered for the better, I believe,
especially on your side of the world. There is
certainly a striking difference between the old
world and the new in reference to these matters.
You Europeans, generally speaking, may be
compared to an old man, whose evil habits have
grown up with him from the days of his ignorance
and foolishness, but which he either cannot see,
or seeing, is unwilling to correct. If you point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
out these to him, he gets impatient and angry, and
then draws his sword, by dint of which he convinces
you that he is in the right. We, on the
other hand, who live in a new world, have new
ideas, and, I may add, true ideas, upon these
subjects. America may be compared to a young
man just come of age, and inexperienced, but who
is endeavouring to learn wisdom from seeing the
stubbornness of old age on the one hand, and from
the true principles of philosophy on the other.
We are not fettered down by old habits, and we
are endeavouring therefore, and I think with some
success to look upon the subject of government
philosophically, and as free as may be from
the influence of prejudice. The single object, I
believe, of the rising states of South America is
the forming such laws or constitutions as may
truly secure the liberty and protection of every
member of the political body, to the greatest degree
possible. Political codes have been drawn
up with this view, and all of them, I believe,
have an article of great importance, namely, that
the constitution shall be revised and improved from
time to time, in order that it may move on towards
perfection, as science and wisdom increase
in the world. You will be saying to yourself, perhaps,
that I am too favourable to my new friends,
and you will be ready to produce against me
the article upon religion as found in most of the
constitutions of this southern continent. You are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
likely, I believe, to form an improper judgment of
this country in reference to that article. You
may be sure I feel the want upon this matter
more than you do, but I endeavour to look upon
the subject with as little prejudice as possible.
When toleration was obtained in England, it was
wrung from the government, I may say, by main
force. The safety of the state demanded it, and
this I suppose had more weight in obtaining for us
this precious blessing, than any qualms of conscience
or political wisdom. Things are quite different
here. There is nobody, I may say, who needs
toleration, and of course nobody is asking it for
himself. I speak of the inhabitants of America,
exclusive of the few foreigners who reside in it.
One of the members of Congress, at the time of
discussing this subject, very pertinently said,
“Why such ado about toleration? Who is asking
for it? or who stands in need of it? We, ourselves,
do not need any such thing, and foreigners,
who are here, seem very little concerned
about the subject. It was not religion that brought
them to this country, but commerce. Give them
money, therefore, in exchange for their goods, and
they will seek nothing else.” Now all this was very
true, however unpalatable. Yet, notwithstanding
the real state of the country in regard to the need of
toleration, a very strong party exists in the Congress
in favour of it; so strong indeed, that it was thought
at one time that it would be gained; and when it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
was lost, a considerable number entered their protest
upon the subject; the first of whom was an
aged priest, and the head of the principal college in
Lima. Now can you tell me when such things took
place in any other country, and originating wholly
from a philosophical view of the matter? Having
seen these things take place, under my own eye,
and having conversed with several members of
Congress and others upon the subject, I feel confident
in stating, that liberal views upon it are
pretty general, at least in this city, and I believe
that this evil will be removed from the Constitution
ere long, perhaps at the first revival of it.</p>

<p>P.S.—Riva Aguera and his friends, are now
prisoners, and his troops have returned to their
duty.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 1st March, 1824.</i></p>

<p>I stated to you, some time ago, my expectation
of being able to introduce the New Testament
undisguised into our school. Blessed be God,
that object is now accomplished. I have sold several
copies to the children publicly in the school. In
the usual course of our lessons, we have occasion
to speak of several incidents in the Gospel history.
On these occasions, I desire our pupils, particularly
on Saturdays, to find out in their New Testaments
where such a thing is spoken of, giving them certain
limits. On the Monday following, a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
are well prepared with their New Testaments
marked with slips of paper at the places in question,
and often through their pretty impatience
to communicate their discoveries, they tell me before
we get into the school, that they have found
out the parable of the sower, the conversion of
Paul, &amp;c. You may easily imagine that these
circumstances are great sources of enjoyment to
me, and make up for many disadvantages. I have
said that we have got the New Testament introduced
into our school <em>undisguised</em>. You probably
perceive what I mean by using the word undisguised.
The truth is, the New Testament, in one
sense, has all along been used in our schools in
South America, not however in the open manner
we now use it in Lima, but, as I may say, disguised;
that is, we have used for lessons extracts
from it, printed on large sheets, and in little books,
thus introducing the Scriptures as it were by
stealth. Each part of these lessons I cause to
be read repeatedly in the classes, until the children
can read them readily. By the time they can do
so, the substance of what they have read, and the
instruction contained in it, is tolerably imprinted
on the memory. Children, you know, have a
habit of repeating to themselves what they have
been saying or reading frequently. In consequence
of this, what portions of Scripture they
have read in the school, they repeat in this way at
home. My excellent friend and companion, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
clergyman, already well known to you, informs me
that several of the parents of our scholars tell him
that their children are talking about the Gospel at
home all the day long. From other quarters I have
heard the same thing, and always with satisfaction
expressed on the part of the parents. Some of the
elder boys, at times, have requested me to lend them
the little books of Scripture extracts, that they might
read them at home; and sometimes the request is,
“My mother desired me to ask you for one of the
little books, as she wishes to read it.” These requests
have been listened to with satisfaction, and
you may be sure, complied with. Seeing this good
disposition in regard to this matter, and considering
the advantages which might flow from this silent
unpresuming introduction of the Holy Scriptures, I
intimated to the children that the little books would
be sold to them at a small expense, and the consequence
was, that many of them were bought immediately.
I mentioned to my clerical friend what I
had done, and my motive for doing it, namely, that
the children and the parents might be improved.
He replied, the books must prove useful to both
parents and children, as what they contain is <em>the
word of God</em>.</p>

<p>You will, perhaps, think I am lengthening out
this subject too much, in talking of our school
affairs. It is a subject, however, of some interest,
considering where our school is, and I am persuaded
you will look upon it as such. I shall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
therefore, proceed a little farther, even at the risk
of being tedious. We have, at certain times, an
exercise for the more advanced boys, which I conceive
to be very useful, and in which they take a
great deal of interest. A Scripture narrative, or
parable, is proposed, which they are required to
read over, by themselves, with great attention, and
to note in their memory all the circumstances and
instruction contained in it. Thus prepared, as
many as <em>choose</em> to exhibit, sit down on a form by
themselves, and one after another stands forward,
without book, and delivers the parable or narrative,
not in the very words of the text, but giving all the
circumstances of the parable in their own artless
way. It is pleasing, and not uninstructive, to hear
them go over their exercise in this manner. Instead,
for instance, of saying that the servant in Matthew,
chap. 18, owed his Lord ten thousand talents, one
will say, he owed him a thousand dollars, another,
perhaps, will say a hundred dollars; whilst, on
the other hand, they will say that the one servant
owed the other “<i>unos pocos cuartillitos</i>,” or, as we
would say in English, a few halfpence. By this
way of saying it, they get into the sense of the passage
themselves, and it is thus also brought down to
the level of the understandings of their younger companions,
all of whom are listening, whilst the attention
of many is rivetted. One of the boys the other day,
in noticing the concluding verse of the 18th of Matthew,
made a very beautiful allusion to the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
petition in the Lord’s Prayer, forgive us
our trespasses as we forgive others. A premium of
two rials (equal to a shilling) was awarded to the
boy who delivered his parable in the best manner.
Several times this reward was proposed and given.
One day they asked me what parable we should
have. I told them I was not sure that we should
have any at all that day, because money was very
scarce with us, and I did not know if we could
spare two rials. But, said they, we may say the
parable, although there be no premium. You take
a pleasure then, said I, in this exercise, do you,
independently of the premium? Yes, said they,
with one accord. Well, I continued, it gives me
great pleasure to see you take so much interest
in this matter, and I can assure you, it is a very
useful exercise, as well as a pleasing one.</p>

<p>I now go on to notice what has occurred here
since my last, in reference to supplies of the Holy
Scriptures, and their distribution. I stated to you
formerly, that we were entirely without a supply of
the Spanish <em>Bible</em> here, and that we had but a few
New Testaments. In hopes of obtaining some
Bibles which were much sought after, I wrote to a
gentleman in Valparaiso, to whom some Bibles
and Testaments had been consigned some time
before by the British and Foreign Bible Society,
with an intimation that they should be at my disposal,
if I wished for them. On learning this, I
immediately wrote to Valparaiso upon the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
requesting the whole to be sent me without delay.
After more than the time necessary for their arrival
had passed by without their appearing, I wrote a
second time, making the same request. I received
an answer to my second letter, as it seems the first
had miscarried, but I was sorry to learn that the
Bibles were all gone. When I say I am sorry for
this, I speak rather in reference to the supplying
of this place, than in reference to the grand object
of distributing the Scriptures in South America.
These Bibles, to the amount of 200, were all distributed,
and mostly by sale, in Valparaiso, so
that, if I am sorry in not being able to supply
those who want here, I am, on the other hand,
glad that my friends in Chile have obtained so
many copies of the sacred word in their own
tongue.</p>

<p>After the accounts which I have now given you,
which are of an encouraging nature, I am sorry in
being under the necessity of giving a gloomy close
to my letter. The Spanish army entered this city
yesterday. I feel as if I were no longer in South
America, but as <em>transported</em> to Spain; and as one
in the visions of the night, finds himself in foreign
climes, he knows not how, and sighs to return
home, so do I sigh to return to South America.
My next letter may, perhaps, inform you, that our
school has been shut up, and that I have taken
my departure for—heaven knows where. There,
however, I shall be, as now, affectionately yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 3d March, 1824.</i></p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the Bibles here, there
were many observations made regarding the faithfulness
of this reprint from the Madrid edition; and many
observations were made also as to the reading the
Scriptures without notes, for the Spanish Bible had
never been seen before without these in this country.
On one of these occasions, in the street one day, when
a priest was speaking freely to some people about him
against reading the Scriptures without the notes, a
friar came up and joined them; and, hearing the observations
of the other against reading, the Bible
without notes, he took up the other side of the
question, and by strong arguments and some wit, he
put his adversary to shame, and convinced those
who were present that it was the best and most
natural way to read the divine instructions just as
they proceeded out of the mouth of him who spoke
as never man spoke, and just as they flowed from
the pens of the inspired messengers.</p>

<p>I have very great satisfaction in stating, that
many of the clergy in this place encourage the
reading of the word of God. This is a cheering
circumstance, and affords good grounds to expect
a large diffusion of divine knowledge; for the word
of God cannot return unto him void, but will accomplish
his gracious will in the instruction and
salvation of mankind wherever it is read. I have
leaned this friendly disposition of the clergy upon
this subject more particularly, since I set agoing
the translation of the New Testament into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Quichua language, as mentioned in my last. All
with whom I have talked upon this subject, both
clergy and laity, are pleased with the object, and I
have not yet heard of any one condemning the
doing of it.</p>

<p>I spoke to a canon, in this place, some time ago
upon the subject, and he voluntarily offered to correct
the proof-sheets in passing through the press, if
I should be at any loss for one to do it. Blessed
be God for this encouragement. May he carry on
and prosper this work, and make it a blessing unto
thousands. In about three months, or less, I expect
the whole of the New Testament will be
translated into the Peruvian tongue. The revision
also is going forward, and from the character and
qualifications of those who are revising it, I trust
the translation will be very faithful, and at the same
time adapted to the capacities of the poor, to whom,
in an especial manner, the gospel is preached.</p>

<p>You will observe by my former letter, that besides
the Quichua, there are two other languages
spoken in Peru, into which it would be desirable
to get a part or the whole of the New Testament
translated. I mentioned to you my application to
the British and Foreign Bible Society for means
to carry forward these translations. I also hinted
that this is properly an <em>American</em> work, and that it
would not be unnatural to look for some assistance
in it to the American Bible Society. Will you
therefore have the goodness to lay this matter before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the board of managers, and request them to favour
me with a communication upon the subject, as early
as convenience will permit. The object is, to
translate the whole Scriptures into the Quichua
language, spoken by upwards of a million, and also
into the Aimará and Moxa languages, spoken each
by upwards of two hundred thousand souls. I add no
more upon this subject for the present, but at the
same time, think it not improper to hint, that I shall
probably have another claim upon your liberality,
in regard to the native languages of Mexico. This
claim may come before you perhaps some twelve
months hence, should our heavenly Father be
pleased to uphold me so long.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 25th March, 1824.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to Mr. S. closed with a foreboding
in regard to our concerns here, from the circumstance
of the Spanish army having entered this
city. On the 29th of February, the Spanish troops,
to the amount of about 2,500, took quiet possession
of this place, there being not the smallest opposition.
The patriot troop had retired a few days
before, leaving us altogether unprotected, and
exposed to those depredations which never fail
to take place in a large city where there is no
government to restrain. We were, in fact, in a
very unpleasant state for some days, and the first
sound of martial music from the Spanish army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
filled me with thanksgiving, as a deliverance from
the anarchy and confusion we had lived in for
some time.</p>

<p>A few days after the arrival of the Spanish
army, and as soon as things were a little tranquillized,
I wrote to the Spanish General, in reference
to our school, telling him what we had done, and
the state in which we were at the time. I represented
to him the nature of our schools, and stated
that establishments of a similar kind had been
introduced and encouraged in various parts of the
world. I of course mentioned particularly what
had been done in Spain. After stating these things,
I requested him to inform me whether we should
go on, or whether we should immediately shut up
our school. In answer to this, I received from
him a very polite letter, saying, that he was
informed and fully persuaded that the school
under my direction was a very useful establishment,
and that he wished it to go on until the
Viceroy should communicate his mind upon the
subject. In my letter to the General I inclosed
a copy of a letter, which I intended to forward
to the Viceroy, and requested his opinion of the
letter, and whether I should send it on to Cuzco.
He replied, that he thought the letter was suitable,
and that if I wished he would himself forward it to
the Viceroy, in order that it might go with greater
security. You may be sure, I thankfully accepted
his offer, and sent him immediately my letter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
forward. Next day I called on the General to
thank him for his kindness in protecting our school,
and in taking the trouble of forwarding my letter
to the Viceroy. I was very kindly received by
him, and encouraged to go on. Thus, you see
we have a new instance of the gracious goodness
of our God in giving me favour with the Governors
of this quarter of the world, however much
opposed to each other.</p>

<p>I informed you, I think, soon after my arrival
in this place, that the government had ordered the
college belonging to the Dominican Friars in this
city to be put at my disposal, for the use of our
school establishment. The removal of the Friars,
and the giving up of the college, was accomplished
without the smallest murmur, or at least audible
murmur, on the part of the monks. This college
is an extensive building, and very well adapted to
the purposes of a central school. We have a large
school room, which will hold very conveniently
300 children, and another large room connected
with it, which would contain 200 more. We
have also several other rooms, very suitable as
lodgings for the masters whilst studying the system,
and there is convenience for a printing office, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The apartments formerly occupied by the
Rector of the college, have formed my own lodging
the greater part of the time I have been in
Lima. Besides the places now mentioned, which
are all connected with each other, we have a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
hall, finely adapted for a female school, with rooms
for the mistress and her assistants. These are entirely
separated from the parts mentioned before,
so that though in the same building, they are
quite distinct places, with separate entrances a
gun-shot from each other. Our boys’ school contains,
at the present time, 230 children, and we have
often been talking of commencing a girls’ school
as a thing greatly wanted in this place. But such
has been the unhappy state of public affairs here
for so long a time, that nothing has yet been done
in it. From the description I have given you of
the building we occupy, and the use to which it
was formerly destined, you might naturally expect
that the Friars gave it up reluctantly, though
without complaining, and that they would still
have their eye upon it, if a favourable opportunity
should present itself for reclaiming it. I am told,
that when the Spaniards were in possession of this
city in June last, the Friars had resolved on petitioning
the government upon the subject, but
the short occupation of the city by the Spanish
troops did not allow them to carry their purpose
into effect. At the present time, the Spaniards
seem to have taken a more permanent possession
of the place, with the intention of continuing in
it for some time, and their possessing the fortresses
of Callao will enable them to do so. We were,
therefore, in greater danger than ever of losing
our college, and indeed application, as I am informed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
was actually made to that effect to General
Monet, the commander of the division in this
quarter. But from what I have stated above,
you will see the happy resolution of the General
in our favour. I should have mentioned, when
describing the college, that there is a church connected
with it, as there is with all the colleges
here. The church and the court connected with
it, are separated by a wall from the parts formerly
mentioned. They were formerly not entirely separated
from each other, as there were two openings,
like gate ways, between the two places.
These, however, I caused to be built up, as I did
not know what kind of companions I might have
in the two Friars who were left to perform the
service of the church; and from the character of
some of this class, and the circumstance of
the loss of their college, and its being put into
the hands of a Protestant, I did not augur much
good from their neighbourhood. We have, however,
lived all along on good terms, and our longer
acquaintance with each other has grown, I think,
into friendship. I met with a proof of this friendship
since the entrance of the Spaniards, which
I did not expect. The Friar who has the principal
charge called upon me one morning, and
informed me that he had heard that the Conde
de Villar de Fuente was to be appointed Governor
of Lima. Now, says he, although he is
a very good man, yet being very friendly to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Friars, it is very likely they will press him hard to
regain their college. You should therefore, continued
he, endeavour to see the Governor as early as
possible, lest they get the start of you to your disadvantage.
I thanked him very kindly for his
intimation and for his advice, and told him that I
was very happy in having this proof of our living
in such friendship with each other. I called upon
the Governor soon after his appointment, agreeably
to the advice of my friend, and found him very
well disposed to continue our establishment and to
encourage it.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 29th March, 1824.</i></p>

<p>The Grecian which brought your letter of 24th
April, and the cases of New Testaments therein
mentioned, arrived at the port of Callao at a very
unfavourable time. The garrison in the castles of
that place had mutinied some ten days previous to
her arrival, and every thing there was in confusion.
The fortresses and town of Callao were in the hands
of the Spaniards, whilst the patriots governed in
Lima. Under these circumstances, I thought it
most prudent not to land the New Testaments, but
to wait some time to see what turn things would
take, and for the same reason I deferred writing
you. On the 29th ultimo, the Spaniards took
possession of this city; they have continued here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
since, and seem likely to do so for some time.
From various circumstances, we have been led to
believe that the Spanish government will not allow
those freedoms which the Patriot government allowed,
in reference to the introduction of books,
&amp;c. In consequence of this, I still considered it
hazardous to land the New Testaments, and therefore
kept them on board so long as the Grecian
continued here; and when she sailed for Chile,
which she did a few days ago, I got them put on
board his Majesty’s ship Fly, now lying in Callao.
I shall thus keep them afloat until I see something
like a certainty of landing them safely. What I
have just said refers only to the 2,500 copies addressed
to the care of Mr. Thwaites, as the rest which
were addressed to Mr. Lynch have been carried
back to Chile in the Grecian, and are to be delivered
there according to instructions given. After
being landed in Valparaiso, they will be forwarded
to Santiago, the capital, and put into the hands of
Mr. Christopher Collis for sale. I have offered
the whole to Mr. Collis at 850 dollars, to be paid
in one month after receiving them; or should he
decline taking them at the rate mentioned, I have
desired him to sell them on my account, charging
the commission he usually takes. The price I have
put upon the New Testaments, when sold one by
one, is eight rials each, and when sold in quantities
to sell again, at six rials each. This you see
will about cover the original cost and expenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
if the whole are taken by Mr. Collis, and if he
retails them they will bring something more. I
think this is a rule that should pretty generally be
attended to, and as few as possible given gratis.
What I have said, applies to these countries of
South America, but other rules may be better
elsewhere. I do think it injurious to make a
general distribution gratis. Individual copies may
be given in this way by a time, but it should be
only at times, and when a clear case presents itself.
The committee will correct me in this if I am
wrong.</p>

<p>On the very day that I received the 610 New
Testaments from Valparaiso, I received a letter
from Truxillo begging most earnestly, and “for
God’s sake” that I would send to that place without
delay a supply of the Holy Scriptures. With
the writer I am well acquainted, and we had many
pleasing interviews during the few weeks I remained
in that place, in June and July of last
year. My friend and correspondent in Truxillo
is a medical gentleman and a native of Ireland.
He has been long in this quarter of the world, and
may be considered rather as a South American,
than a native of the British Isles. He is of
the Roman Catholic religion, but is free from
those prejudices to be found among many of
his own communion. He studies the word of
God himself, and recommends the study of it
most earnestly to all his friends around him. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
found him with a single Spanish New Testament
of one of your earlier editions. This was to him
quite a family piece, and his wife and children take
great pleasure in reading it. A copy of the whole
Bible in the Spanish language he had not been able
to procure at that time, but in the letter referred
to, he tells me he had obtained one from a friend
who purchased it in Lima at the time of Mr.
Lynch’s sale. When we were together in Truxillo,
I inculcated upon him strongly the importance of
doing every thing in his power to make the Word
of God have free course and be glorified as far as
in him lay. To this he most cheerfully agreed, and
indeed was more ready to enter into it than I could
be to lay it before him. He told me that he was
personally acquainted with most of the rectors in
the various districts throughout the extensive province
of Truxillo, which contains a population of
about 300,000 souls. To each of these rectors he
promised to write upon the subject, and was pretty
confident that they would, in answer to his letters,
request large supplies of the Scriptures. I promised
on my part to supply him amply with New
Testaments very soon, and with Bibles as soon as
I could have a supply from England. Upon my
return to Lima, I sent him 50 Spanish New Testaments,
some of the Annual Reports of the Society,
some religious tracts, &amp;c. These were sent under
the particular care of a mutual friend, who sailed for
Santa, and intended to send them overland to Truxillo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
This happened to be at the time of one of our civil
commotions, and when our friend landed at Santa
all communication was interrupted between that
and Truxillo. From Santa he sailed to Guayaquil,
and not finding a convenient opportunity for
sending them back to Truxillo, he sold them there,
and wrote our friend to that effect, saying he would
account to me for the price of them. This was a
great disappointment to Mr. O’Donovan, for that
is the name of our fellow-labourer; and to remedy
it, he wrote me the letter above mentioned. He
urges his claim from the circumstance of the great
need there is of the Word of God in that quarter,
from his having promised to send copies to his
friends, the rectors, agreeably to what was before
stated, and from the circumstance of a number of
copies of two infidel books which had been just
landed from a French ship in that place, and which
have done much evil in these countries. Often do
I think, my dear Sir, and often do I say, that this
is a most critical time for South America, in a religious
point of view.</p>

<p>Two days after having received his letter, I
sent him off 250 copies, in common binding, and
ten in calf extra. The patience, however, of our
friend has again been put to the trial, for notwithstanding
that the box containing this supply was
sent down to Callao immediately, yet on account
of the confusion in that place, as above mentioned,
it only went off a few days ago. I imagine him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
just now opening it, and satiating his eyes with
its sacred contents. In the conclusion of his
letter, he says he intends to go from house to house
to urge these “ignorant but docile Christians” to
receive the treasure offered them. Let us pray that
his benevolent and zealous efforts may be crowned
with happy success.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 30th March, 1824.</i></p>

<p>We have at present three masters learning our
system, and whom we expected to place in other
schools before now; but this war literally devours up
every thing, and ties us down to a spot. When we
shall clap our wings and fly over the Andes, to teach
the poor Peruvian in his native tongue, I cannot
tell: God may, perhaps, bring this about sooner than
we expect. In the course of a week, the whole of
the New Testament will be translated into the vernacular
language of Manco Capac, and by a descendant
of that ancient race of kings.</p>

<p>I have written to the Viceroy La Serna, who
resides at present in Cuzco, requesting to know his
determination regarding the continuing of our
system, under his government, in this city, and
whether he is desirous of extending it throughout
the country. In something less than two months
I shall probably hear from him, and shall communicate
to you the result. If the answer be favourable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
I shall most likely repair immediately to
Cuzco, leaving one of the masters before mentioned
in charge of this school; and should his answer be
unfavourable, I shall leave this place and go northwards.</p>

<p>We have often been very desirous of commencing
a girls’ school in this city, and we have very good
accommodations in our college for this purpose;
but we have never been able to effect it, in consequence
of the extreme scarcity of money at
present in this city. If Lima had been in its former
state of abundance, we could have effected it
with great ease; and it would have been a very
great blessing to this place. We would, in that
case, have been very desirous of receiving a well-qualified
teacher from your Committee, to direct
our female department. It would still be preferable
to send two, as one of them could attend to
the public school, and the other might keep a
respectable boarding-school for the higher classes.
Regarding this last-mentioned part, several parents
have spoken to me; and on the whole, I think it
would turn out well for those who might come out
for that purpose. Such an establishment I am
sure would be the means of doing a great deal of
good in this country. Female education, in my
opinion, is the thing most wanted in every country;
and when it shall be properly attended to, the
renovation of the world will go on rapidly. Let us
know if you could aid us in these matters, if we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
were directly to apply to you. I notice these things
that you may write me upon the subject, and
knowing, from experience, how ready you are, at
all times, to listen to every proposition which bears
on knowledge and benevolence.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 12th April, 1824.</i></p>

<p>You have, more than once, requested me to state
to you any interesting conversations I might have at
times with individuals of this country, upon the subject
of religion. I have not, I believe, been very
communicative in my letters to you on this subject.
I believe such details might, in many cases, be interesting,
but generally speaking, the questions
and answers upon these matters are so nearly what
we might expect them to be before hand, under the
given circumstances, that little of what can be
called solid information is derived therefrom; besides,
I understand you print some of my letters,
and there is some delicacy and caution to be used
under such a consideration, more especially as I
have never seen any of your printed accounts, and
am thus unable to judge of the freedom you use in
such matters. I hope in your selections for the
press, you will be wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves.</p>

<p>I shall now detail to you a conversation which I
had a few days ago, with a particular friend, upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the subject of religion, and more particularly upon
the Catholic and Protestant controversy. The
gentleman, with whom I had the conversation, is a
man of superior education and abilities, and holds an
important situation in one of our colleges. We have
been acquainted with each other ever since I arrived
in this city. We have visited each other occasionally
during that time, and have talked upon religious
subjects, but almost always upon those things in
which we were agreed. A few days ago I had a
visit from him, and we entered almost immediately
into a close conversation or controversy upon some
of the points of the Catholic religion. I had
lying on the table one of the Pope’s bulls, which a
young man had brought me a day or two before, as
I had expressed to him a desire to see it. I enquired
of my friend, where I could obtain a set of
these bulls, as I wished to see each of them, in
order to ascertain their nature, and what it was
they promised to those who should purchase them.
After he had informed me where this article was to
be found, I told him that I understood that those
who purchased one of these bulls at a certain
price, namely, eight dollars and a half, were
assured that they would get out of purgatory in
two or three days after death. He said it was so
as I had stated. Do you then really believe, said
I, that the Pope can thus pardon the sins of men,
and that men can obtain the pardon of their sins
by means of expending such a sum of money in the
purchase of this bull.—He said he believed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
forgiveness of sins could be obtained in the way
mentioned, and that the Pope had such authority
in virtue of being the successor of the prince of the
apostles, to whom Jesus Christ had granted the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and power to remit
or to retain the sins of men. It is to be supposed,
however, continued he, that confession of sins is to
be made in order to this forgiveness. And in confession
to whom can the penitent go but to the
minister of Christ, in order that they may instruct
him in the nature of repentance? To prevent him
from deceiving himself, and believing he has repented
when he has not, it is necessary to show
him what are the signs of a sincere repentance; and
when the priest finds the penitent as he ought to
be, then in virtue of the power given by Christ to
his ministers, they absolve him from his sins.—In
answer to what he said, I told him that I considered
it to be the duty of man to confess his sins unto
God, as it is with him alone we have to do, and
not with one another; and that the Scripture assures
us, that if we humbly and sincerely confess our sins
unto him, and beg forgiveness through the Lord
Jesus Christ, we shall obtain the mercy we ask for. I
then said, that I believed none could forgive sins but
God only; and that as to the power given to the
apostle Peter, and also to the other apostles to forgive
the sins of men or to retain them, I conceived
it to be a power of doing this only in a certain way,
namely, in the way corresponding to the instructions
which they had received from their divine Master.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
I illustrated this by the case of an ambassador
sent by his sovereign with terms of peace to a
neighbouring prince. The Ambassador, I said, is
authorized to make peace between the two nations,
that is, to put an end to the war or to continue it.
He is not, however, at liberty to do this in any
way he chooses, but only in that way which the
instructions of his sovereign authorize. So was
it, I continued, with the ambassadors whom the
Lord Jesus sent into the world; they were sent to
proclaim and to celebrate a peace between God
and man, but they were to do so only in one way,
that is, in the way prescribed to them, and of which,
I observed, we shall presently speak. As to the superiority
of the Apostle Peter, said I, to which you
refer, or to speak more properly, the superior honour
conferred upon him, it is easy to see in what it consisted,
and how far it extended. To him were promised
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and also
the power of remitting and retaining sins; this latter
power was also conferred upon the other Apostles, so
that the difference, or the superior honour conferred
upon Peter, consisted in having the keys put into
his hands. Keys are for the unlocking of doors, that
a free entrance may be had to a place inaccessible
before the gates were opened. Now, said I, the
Apostle Peter was honoured by his Lord, to open
the gates of the kingdom of heaven, in the first
place unto the Jews, and which he accordingly did
in his sermon on the day of Pentecost, and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
which means three thousand entered the church of
God at one rush. The same individual was afterwards
honoured <em>to open the door</em> of faith unto the
Gentiles, by a special commission from heaven to
that effect. Having thus opened the gates of the
kingdom of heaven unto the Jews, and also unto
the Gentiles, there was no farther use for these keys.
The Apostles of our Lord, in regard to authority in the
church, were exactly upon a level, none was superior
and none was inferior. And now, I continued, with
regard to what we were speaking of before, namely,
the forgiveness of sins, I conceive the Apostles could
do it only by making known the message of peace
and reconciliation to their fellow sinners, and by declaring,
in the name of their Master, to those who
believed their testimony, the remission of sins consequent
upon their belief; and on the other hand,
they retained the sins of men, by declaring unto
those who disbelieved their testimony, that the
wrath of God remained upon them. Further, I
said, regarding the successors of the Apostles, I
conceived that strictly speaking they had none, nor
were there any required. In their life time they
exercised their authority, and fulfilled their commission
in the way I have stated. And knowing
that they were not to continue long upon the earth,
and being desirous that these sacred truths which
they preached into men should always be held in
remembrance, they committed them to writing, and
these writings, through the blessing of God, remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
unto this day. The Apostles, therefore, have made
their own writings their successors, and thus,
through them, they continue still to speak to mankind;
they still publish the message of reconciliation,
and whose sins soever <em>they</em> remit, they are remitted,
and whose soever sins <em>they</em> retain, they are retained.
I remarked a little before, I continued, that it was
at their peril that the Apostles acted in any other
way in the forgiving and retaining of sins, and I
now add, that it is at the peril of men to receive
the remission of sins in any other way than in that
which the Apostles taught. The great and eventful
day that awaits us all, will declare on what authority
and foundation we have enjoyed peace in
this weighty affair. The precious stones, the gold
and the silver will stand the fire which is to try
them, but the wood, the hay, and the stubble shall
be burned up.</p>

<p>When I had finished the observations which
I have now mentioned, my friend took his turn
to speak, and stated his mind upon these topics
with great clearness and eloquence to the following
effect:—My dear Sir, in regard to the explanation
of the passage on which you have now given your
opinion, and also with regard to the explanation
of the Scriptures in general, I conceive our best
and surest plan is to have recourse to the uniform
explanation and judgment of the church. If
every one is at liberty to form his own opinion
of the meaning of Scripture, there will be nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
as many opinions as there are individuals. Witness
the divisions which exist among the Protestants,
in consequence of this liberty which they
take of explaining the Scripture, every one as
appears best to him. One believes a certain thing,
another denies it, and a third believes something
different from both. Every truth in the Scripture
has thus been defended and opposed, and torn in
pieces by this principle, of every one explaining
according to his own judgment and fancy. Under
these circumstances, what a consolation it is to have
an authority to which we can in all cases recur,
and in whose decision we can rest fully satisfied.
This authority is <em>the church</em>,—which Jesus Christ
has invested with full power on all these points.
In consequence of this, the noble truths of our
religion continue as they were in the beginning.
The judgment of the church has never varied upon
them as it has done among the Protestants, neither
can it vary. We have the promise of Jesus Christ
that he will be with his church to the end of the
world, and that whatsoever shall be bound by its
judgment upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven,
and that whatsoever shall be loosed by it on
earth, shall be loosed in heaven. My dear friend,
here is our foundation, here is our authority and
consolation. The Catholic church has continued
since the days of the Apostles and has had an uninterrupted
succession of Bishops, from St. Peter
until the present day. The Protestants cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
plead such a succession. They are but a sect
which left the church a century or two ago, and
still occupy a small portion of the world; whereas
the Catholic church, descending from the Apostles,
has spread on every side, and its doctrines have
continued pure and uncorrupted from the beginning
until now, yea, and they will continue so until
the end of the world, for Jesus Christ has promised
it. Here, my friend, is firm footing, and all else,
be assured, is quicksand and uncertainty. I was
born a Catholic, and I adhere to the religion of my
country, and in which I was educated. It is not,
however, from the circumstance of being brought
up in this religion that I now adhere to it. No,
Sir, on the contrary, when I came of age I began
to entertain doubts about our religion. Upon this,
I set myself to examine the subject with diligence
and attention, and the result was a thorough persuasion
of its firm and unalterable foundation, and
of the beauty and grandeur of the structure. I look
upon the Catholic religion, therefore, with great delight
and confidence. It appears to me like a great
and majestic river running through an extensive continent.
On one hand it makes its way, tumbling
over rocks, yet uninterrupted in its course by such
impediments; again, it meets in its course with
shelves and dykes, and after being retarded a little
by these hindrances it breaks its way over, and then
holds its noble and majestic course until it reaches
the ocean, enriching and beautifying every place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
through which it flows. Such is our religion, and
I clasp it to my bosom and esteem it my best and
only treasure.</p>

<p>When he had finished, I observed to him, that
the plan of the Church explaining all doubts and
difficulties regarding the meaning of every part of
Scripture, and of our resting in that decision, had
the appearance of possessing many advantages.
How desirable is it that we should be able to set
our minds at rest on subjects of such importance,
and wherein a mistake or an error might be attended
with very serious consequences. But there
appears to me, I said, a great difficulty to be got
over, before we can allow our minds to enjoy the
ease and confidence referred to, by resting in an
infallible interpreter. The difficulty I speak of
is this: How shall I know that the church has
indeed the authority you speak of? If I were
fully satisfied that the church possesses this authority,
I would, I assure you, fully confide in it.
You remember that, in a former conversation, you
promised to prove your positions regarding the Catholic
Church with evidence as satisfactory as the
proof, that the three interior angles of a triangle
are equal to two right angles. Now, I continued
to observe, I cannot see evidence for believing that
the church has the power in question, and I cannot
receive it as a doctrine until I be convinced.
On what then do you build this doctrine?</p>

<p>I build this doctrine, said he, in the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
on the promises of Jesus Christ to his church, which
are these: “whose sins soever ye remit, they are
remitted, and whose soever sins ye retain they
are retained; whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven; and again, I will be
with you always even unto the end of the world.”
In the second place, said he, from the consideration
that the promises of Jesus to his church, must
necessarily have been fulfilled, I maintain that the
church has been guided by the Spirit in the manner
I have stated, and in consequence thereof,
she has held the same doctrine from the days of
the Apostles until the present time.</p>

<p>I differ from you, I replied, regarding the meaning
and application of the passages you have quoted
from the Scriptures. But as you will have the church
to explain them, and as the church does actually
explain them as you have stated, we cannot therefore
meet each other here, on open ground.
Let us then pass on to the other fundamental
principle which you hold, namely, the fulfilling
of this promise in the way you have explained it.
How then do you prove to me, that the church has
never varied in her doctrines?—I prove, said he,
the constancy and stability of the church by the
uniform voice of ecclesiastical writers, from the
days of the Apostles until now. No sooner did
any pastor or bishop broach any new doctrine, than
his own flock, and the whole body of Christians,
every where raised the cry against him. Errors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
now and then arose, continued he, and errors too of
great consequence, but in this manner they were publicly
reprobated, and the individuals who had erred
were thereby brought to repentance, or else expelled
the church.—As I wished to drive this subject
to its proper issue, and to fix upon the very
point upon which we differed, and which point it
was necessary to settle before we could proceed
farther with any advantage, I put this question to
him: Do you maintain that the writers upon ecclesiastical
affairs, from the days of the Apostles downward,
have all held the same opinions regarding
the interpretation of Scripture? Not exactly so, said
he, for there have been differences among them regarding
the interpretation of several passages of Scripture;
and he here instanced several opinions of St.
Augustine, St. Cyprian, &amp;c. But so far, continued
he, as respects what are strictly and properly called
the <em>doctrines</em> of the church, I maintain that there
is no difference among them, although in points of
discipline they are not all agreed. You hold then,
said I, do you, that so far as the <em>doctrines</em> of the
Roman Catholic church are concerned, the writers
we speak of do not vary? I expected he would here
give an answer at once in the affirmative, but he withdrew
a little farther, and said that he would not
affirm to the question I had put, as to <em>all</em> that
these writers had said; but so far only, as they
had given their <em>testimony</em> to the doctrines in question
as existing among them, he wished to speak, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
as to their own opinions of these doctrines. He here
stated some <em>opinions</em> of the fathers, and said, that so
far as they acted as <em>witnesses</em> to what existed among
them, and in the ages previous to their time, thus far
and no further were their writings to be considered
respecting the argument in hand. I here reminded
him by the way, of what I had before urged, but
which he did not concede, namely, that there were
a great variety of opinions among the Catholics as
well as among the Protestants. I stated, at the
same time, that I did not urge this particularly as
an objection to their system, but merely as a counterpart
to his objection to the Protestants, arising
from their differences. I then put the question:
Do you maintain then, that so far as ecclesiastical
writers have given testimony to the doctrines of the
church, they do not vary, nor can vary?—Yes, said
he, I do maintain that position.—I then replied, I
am glad we have come at length to this one definite
point, and I am glad, also, that you have excluded
the opinions of the writers on these subjects, and that
you rest solely on them as witnesses. I now see the
point you maintain, and here we will come to issue.
My answer, for the present, shall be short. This
position which you maintain, is a position which I
believe to be insupportable, and which, in consequence,
I deny. Here, then, let the subject for
the present rest; we have got a great length in
seeing the very line which divides us, and we have
now the matter free of mystery. It is reduced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
a mere historical question. We shall, therefore, decide
it as such on some future occasion, when I shall
take in hand to prove that the church <em>has varied</em>.</p>

<p>We have now seen, said I, the very point in
which we differ, let us also see where we agree.
I believe, said I, that all mankind are sinners, and
stand in need of a Saviour. I believe that God
pitied our race, and sent his only begotten Son to
seek and to save the lost. I believe that the Lord
Jesus Christ is the true Mediator and Saviour of
mankind, and that there is no other name under
heaven by which we can be saved. I do sincerely
believe, I continued, in the Lord Jesus Christ as
my Lord and my Redeemer; and, I trust, also that
I desire to know all his precepts and instructions,
and to conform my thoughts, and words, and
actions thereunto.—I then said to him, is not this
exactly what you believe?—He said it was so.
Well then, I replied, may not we look upon each
other as fellow disciples, and may not we each
expect, if we hold on, that the Lord will give unto
us both that crown of righteousness which he hath
promised to them that love him? He here seemed
to hesitate, and did not give a direct reply. You
see that I was here touching upon the point of
there being no salvation out of <em>their</em> church.—He
said that what I had stated regarding my faith was
well, but that there was something farther necessary,
and upon saying so, he seemed to digress a little,
or, at least, not to speak directly to the point in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
hand. My dear Sir, said I, pray let us settle this
point. Have the goodness to speak your mind
freely; speak out, what do I still want, what more
must I believe, than what I have stated, in order to
obtain eternal life. Did not the Lord Jesus himself
concede eternal life to those who believed what I
have told you in my belief? And did not the
Apostles, according to the power invested in them,
remit the sins of those who believed and acted in
the manner I have stated? He then said something
about the necessity of believing the church,
in order to salvation.—Can I not look for salvation
without this? said I.—Take care that you do not
put obstacles in the way to heaven, which the God
of our salvation has not put. Strait is the gate,
and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life,
pray then, do not with stumbling blocks fill up this
narrow way. Let the Lord Jesus and his Apostles
guide us in this, and in all matters that concern the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Upon arriving here we found our time was gone,
and that we had been upwards of two hours in a
very close conversation. As my friend could stop
no longer, we broke up our conversation at this
point, he still stating it as necessary to salvation,
that I should believe the church. When we thus
dropped our disputation, he arose, and as I accompanied
him out, he threw his arms around me, and
said, “We shall yet, I trust, be united together,
and companions in our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>I have lengthened my account of this interview,
perhaps unnecessarily, and it may be till I have
tired you. By way of excuse, I would say that I
felt real interest in the conversation, and my endeavour
has been to make you participate with me,
as I believe what interests and pleases one of us is
not unpleasing, nor without interest, to the other.
It often happens, however, that what interests us
in a conversation or narrative loses its effect upon
others by the imperfect way in which we repeat it.
In the present instance, this is very likely the
case, but I leave you to judge.</p>

<p>I have only to remark, before I conclude, that
the point in dispute between us is now reduced to
narrow limits; and it was my main endeavour to
bring it to this bearing, nor was he averse to it.
He is, as I said at the outset, a man of good
talents, and reasons clearly. I do not promise to
you that we shall be able to set the subject at rest
in our next conference, notwithstanding all the
accuracy and honesty of my good friend. You
know there are many things which prevent such an
anticipation. I shall, however, endeavour to prove
to him, in the first place, that the church <em>at</em> Rome,
and other churches in the days of the Apostles,
held the doctrines and followed the practices which
are contained in the New Testament. With these
doctrines I shall then compare the doctrines of the
church of Rome in the present day; and if I can
show a disparity between them, I think impartiality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
should give the judgment in my favour, even without
entering upon ecclesiastical history; as I shall
thus have proved that the church <em>has varied</em>, and
hence that those passages he referred to, must be
misinterpreted by Romish writers, and that they
do not apply to their church, whose infallibility
must, of course, fall to the ground, agreeably to
the principles stated in the preceding conversation.
Should, however, justice not speak out in my
favour, I shall pass on to show, from ecclesiastical
writers, that the doctrines of the Church of Rome
differ in the present day from what they were in the
first and second centuries, and even later. By this
means I hope to arrive at the same conclusion, as
in the way before mentioned, and thus to disprove
my friend’s position of the church never having
varied, by the very means by which he maintains it.
This I conceive, is the only way of managing the
controversy between the Catholic and the Protestant.
Until you settle this point about the authority
of the church, you can do nothing effectually.
If you cite, for instance, a passage of
Scripture to disprove any one of the doctrines of
the Catholic church, you are met immediately with
the interpretation which the church puts upon that
passage, and there is an end of it. If you should
allege that the passage plainly and evidently means
something very different from each interpretation,
then you are reminded that our judgement is weak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and erring, and that the judgment of the church is
infallible. So that to whatever hand you turn,
you never can get out of this circle. It is therefore
necessary to demolish this outwork entirely.
What I have said of course applies chiefly to the
mode of reasoning with those who are thorough-paced
in their theological arguments; but with
regard to others, you can attack them in any particular
part, and carry your argument forward on
the principles of common sense, and by the doctrines
of Scripture taken in their plain and obvious
meaning.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 1st June, 1824.</i></p>

<p>In the conclusion of my letter of the 1st of March,
I noticed that this city had been taken possession
of by the Spanish army. It is still in their possession,
and there does not appear, at present, any immediate
prospect of a change in this respect. You
will not expect from me political news under present
circumstances, and I pass on to note what little
affairs have come under my observation during
these two or three months past, respecting that
kingdom which cannot be moved by the strifes of
men, nor the clangour of war.</p>

<p>My letter to Mr. H. of 25th March would inform
you of the protection which the Spanish General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
granted to our schools. In consequence of that
encouragement, I resolved to remain her some
time longer, in order to put our establishment upon
as sure a footing as possible. Nothing material
occurred in our school upon the arrival of the
Spaniards, except the losing of some of our scholars.
The cause of this was the dread their parents were
in, lest their children should be seized on their
way to and from the school by the recruiting parties,
who not infrequently take some of the bigger boys
as they find them in the street, in order to make
drummers of them. Our number, in consequence
of this, is less than it was about three months ago.
In these times, when party spirit runs high, we
endeavour in our school to maintain a strict neutrality
in words and actions. We found some
difficulty during the first days, after our change of
rulers, to establish this neutrality among the children
themselves. They would, from time to time,
be forming themselves into sides, and calling each
other respectively Patriots and Goths. We have
in the school, children whose parents have taken
opposite sides in this contest, and as might naturally
be expected, the children on the one hand
and on the other have imbibed the sentiments of
their parents. We succeeded at length in putting
an end to these strifes among the children, and
we now all live in peace and unity. The government
holds out to us no immediate encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
and on the other hand, it never in any shape interferes
with our operations. On the whole, this
school is going on very well. The children are
making progress in their learning, and advancing
in moral dignity; and some are lisping out, and
some are reading with readiness, the gracious
words which proceeded out of the mouth of our
blessed Saviour, as they were taken down by the
Holy Spirit. I may add, that we are not losing
the estimation of our friends here, but on the contrary,
if I mistake not, we are gaining more friends
in both parties, and making advances in public confidence.</p>

<p>About three weeks ago I was on the eve of
leaving this place, and had, as on a former occasion,
every thing packed up with that intention.
I had indeed resolved to sail for Guayaquil with
the first ship, and was inquiring for a passage. My
reasons for doing so were quite solid. My salary,
as I suppose you know, is paid by the government.
Under present circumstances, the payment
of the troops is the first thing attended to, and to
procure funds sufficient for this purpose, requires
great exertions in the present exhausted state of
this place. To obtain this supply, all the ordinary
sources of revenue are laid hold of, and pretty
heavy contributions also are laid on the inhabitants
to make up deficiencies. This being the case,
there was no prospect of my obtaining any supplies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
more especially as persons in the immediate employ
of the government, and who have salaries
assigned them, could obtain nothing. To make
certain, however, I made application, and found
it impossible to obtain any thing, on account
of the circumstances mentioned. As you know
I have no supplies but what my own hands provide
me with, it became an imperative duty to
remove when my usual resources were dried up.
These were my reasons for going, and I suppose
you will consider them sufficient, especially if you
take into consideration the high price of all kinds
of provisions in this city. Sugar for instance,
which grows and is manufactured within a few
miles of the city, is now selling at twenty-pence
and two shillings the pound.</p>

<p>Being ready for setting off, as above mentioned,
and having given notice to the children
to that effect, I waited only till the following
day to send my luggage down to Callao, and to
follow it immediately. Whilst I was thus prepared,
my good friend the clergyman, whom I have frequently
mentioned in my former letters, called
upon me, and said that he believed I would not
go away yet, notwithstanding all my preparations.
I smiled at what he said, and replied, that my
going appeared very certain and very near too,
for I intended to send my luggage to Callao
next morning.—Well, I do not think you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
go away for all that, said he.—Upon my asking
him what reasons he had for saying so, he stated,
that he had been speaking with some of the parents
of the children, and that they had expressed to him
their concern at my going, and said they would
very willingly contribute what they could, and
would speak to some others who had children in
the school, and that they hoped by that means
something might be raised, which might, in a great
measure, remove the reasons I had stated for my
going. Whilst my friend and I were talking to
this effect, a person came in who had a son at
school, and repeated the same things. I replied,
that I felt very much obliged by the confidence
they reposed in me, and for their friendly interference
for my continuance in this place. I noticed
also that I had candidly stated my reasons
for going away at this time, and that though
they had kindly proposed a way of removing these
difficulties, yet I felt a delicacy in calling on the
parents of the children on my own behalf. They replied
to this by saying that they would speak to some
of their friends upon the subject, and that in fact
they had spoken to some of those of most influence
who were very cordial and anxious in the matter;
and my friend the clergyman proposed to write
notes to others of the parents, in his own name, to
remove any delicacies I might have as to the application.
Upon seeing so much interest taken in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
this matter, I recognized the hand of God in it,
and agreed to their proposal. Their plan has been
carried into effect, and this has the Lord opened,
as it were, a window in heaven, and let down before
me a sheet full of supplies. In this same
manner, I may say, has the Lord provided for me
during the years of my pilgrimage in this foreign
land. He has set a table before me, he has
anointed my head with oil, he has made my cup
to run over. Surely goodness and mercy will
follow me all the days of my life, and O may
I dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 15th July, 1824.</i></p>

<p>Your very acceptable favour of 6th January
last, came safely into my hands on the 22d ultimo,
and I have now the pleasure of writing you a few
lines in reply. Your notice of the progress of
Bible Societies in France is very interesting, and
it is not less so what you mention regarding the
circulation of the Holy Scriptures in Egypt, and in
Jerusalem, the city of the great King. To whatever
quarter we turn our eyes, we behold the word
of God silently making its way into the hands of
men of every nation and of every language, saying
unto all, Fear God, and give glory to his name,
for the day of his merciful visitation is come. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
strains of the Bible Society remind us of the song
of the heavenly messengers upon their announcing
the Advent of our great Deliverer. The language
of both is, “Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth, peace, good will towards men.”</p>

<p>It affords me much satisfaction to observe the
interest which the Society takes on behalf of South
America, and I hope the day is coming when we
shall be more sensible of your favours to us, and
when we shall join together in grateful acknowledgment
of your godly benevolence. Have the
goodness to convey my sincere thanks to the Committee,
for the readiness with which they have acceded
to my request respecting the translating and
printing of a part of the Holy Scriptures into the
ancient Peruvian tongue. I thought I should, by
this time, have been able to give you a very favourable
account of the progress of this work, but
we are subject here to sad vicissitudes, for war
rages in the land, and of late the sword has reached
unto our very soul. How long we shall be visited
with this scourge I cannot tell. The Judge of all
the earth will do right, and it is our duty to submit
to his holy will.</p>

<p>The translation of the whole of the New Testament
into the Peruvian language was finished
about two months ago. The Gospel by Luke has
been very carefully revised and corrected by four
individuals, one of whom is a Clergyman, another
is a Theological Tutor in one of the colleges of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
city, and the other two are of the medical profession.
These four, along with the gentleman who
made the translation, went over this gospel verse
by verse, with great care. The present corrected
version, therefore, is the joint work of <em>five</em> persons,
and I trust it may be relied on with some confidence.
It has not yet been put to the press, for
we have not had a printing press in Lima during
these four months past. There are two indifferent
ones in Callao, one of them in the castle and the
other under its guns, but I have not yet been able
to ascertain, since I received your letter, whether
any thing can be done at these or not. In my next
I shall inform you more particularly upon this subject,
and if the printing shall be then begun, I shall
forward you a copy of the first sheet.</p>

<p>In my letter to Mr. Ronneberg of 29th March
last, I noticed the safe arrival of the Grecian in
Callao, bringing the 2,500 Spanish New Testaments
addressed to me, and the 1,592 addressed to Mr.
Lynch. Of the six boxes which came to me, I have
sent two to Guatemala by a favourable opportunity
which offered. I have also sent one to Arequipa,
and one to Truxillo, and two yet remain on hand.
A few weeks ago I received from Captain Robson,
of the Sesostris, two boxes of New Testaments,
(Paris edition,) containing about 500 each. These
he received, I believe, from the Merchants’ Bible Society,
or from some other of the Societies in London.</p>

<p>In the letter already referred to, I noticed what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
had taken place with regard to 50 New Testaments,
which I sent to Truxillo some time ago.
I mentioned the impossibility of getting them conveyed
to Truxillo under the circumstances then
existing in that place, and that in consequence
they were carried to Guayaquil. I have since
received a very pleasing letter regarding their reception
in that place, of which the following is an
extract.</p>

<p>“It is with the utmost pleasure I sit down to
write these few lines to you, to inform you of the
hunger and thirst after the word of God in this
part of the world. You may remember, that when
I last left Lima you gave me a box containing
Tracts and Testaments, for Dr. O’Donovan in
Truxillo, but from the then existing state of the
country it was out of my power to forward the
above mentioned box to Truxillo, and as we were
not allowed to enter that port, we were consequently
obliged to proceed to Guayaquil. I
wrote you from that place, saying, that I was
bound for the coast of Mexico, but as affairs would
not permit it, I made a trading voyage to Jipijapi,
Monte Cristi, and the Bay of Caracas. But before
leaving Guayaquil some one got knowledge
of my having these Testaments, and the demand
was so great, that it was almost out of my power to
save any of them, although it was my intention to
do so, for the other above mentioned parts; and as
I had no likely opportunity of forwarding them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Mr. O’Donovan, I thought it best to circulate
them, and not to let such a treasure lie hid in darkness;
and I am convinced that it is in general considered
as a treasure; for with pleasure have I
seen, in passing through the streets of Guayaquil,
not once or twice, but mostly every day, the shopkeepers,
and the poor people who have stalls, read
in the blessed Gospel of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. If I had had ten times as many, I am
persuaded I could have sold them all. On my
arrival in this port, (Monte Cristi, latitude 3°
south) I had no Testaments, but a few tracts, and
some of the instructions of the Lancasterian system
of teaching; I gave the latter to different school-masters,
and likewise a few tracts along with them.
A day or two after it was known that I had tracts
on board, it was astonishing, but at the same time
pleasing, to see both old and young coming after me
in the street, and to where I lived, requesting me
either to sell or give them one of each kind.
There was one tract in particular, which, to my
knowledge, was sent twenty leagues to a curate,
an acquaintance of mine, and on my going to some
of the inland towns, which I had occasion at times
to do, there was always particular inquiry for
Tracts and New Testaments. I had once, about
four years ago, distributed a few Testaments in
Monte Cristi, one or two of which I saw this time.
Such is the thirst after the word of God, that the
Governor and two or three more, requested me as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
particular favour, that I would leave a New Testament
I had for my own use, until I should return,
and begged and even offered money, so that I
would bring either the New Testament or the
whole Bible on my return. The Governor, after
reading the rules of the Lancasterian plan of teaching,
gave orders in my presence to some of the
school-masters to conform to some of the rules as
near as they could. He seems to be a young man
very much inclined to forward any thing that tends
to promote the education of youth. At this moment
I am surrounded with children requesting
tracts, but as my stock is small, I am very particular
to whom I give them, making every one
read a sentence or two before they get a tract.—It
gives me infinite pleasure to be thus employed in
distributing the word of God to those that hunger
and thirst after righteousness; and after the fatigues
of the day, I feel refreshed to be thus employed.”</p>

<p>The information contained in the above extract
is very interesting, and I trust many other instances
will be witnessed upon this continent, of a sincere
desire to possess, and to read the Holy Scriptures.
I shall take care to seize the first opportunity of
sending a supply of New Testaments to Guayaquil
and parts adjacent. It often occurs to me that it
might prove very useful to make journeys through
various parts of this country, in order to dispose of
the Scriptures to the best advantage, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
greatest extent possible. I felt much inclined to
employ a person in whom I have confidence, in
such journies, but did not like to do so at your
expense without orders, and my own funds at
present cannot afford it.—I have as yet received
no answer to my letter to the Viceroy, and am
quite uncertain as to the time I remain here. I
had almost forgot to mention to you the safe arrival
of the parcel containing the Brief View, in Spanish.
Many copies of this have already been circulated,
and they have produced a good effect.</p>

<p>I conclude, my dear Sir, by praying that an
abundant measure of the Holy Spirit may be
poured out upon yourself, and upon all your associates.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Lima, 1st September, 1824.</i></p>

<p>Many feelings, my dear friend, rush upon my
mind on the present occasion. I shall, at once,
give you to understand something of the number
and the nature of these, by telling you,—that
I have just now shut up my house, have taken
leave of the children and of several warm friends,
and go down immediately to Callao, to embark for
Truxillo and Guayaquil; and from the latter place
I intend to go to Bogotá; and thence onward from
one place to another, until perhaps, and if the Lord
will, I shall see you face to face. In consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
these things, as you may easily suppose, I have my
mind full of past, and of present, and of future objects.
I think of my parting from you more than six
years ago; I think of the wonderful way by which
the Lord has preserved me, and led me, and blessed
me in this foreign land; I think of the goodness of
God in having allowed me to drop a seed here and
a seed there in this continent, which appears a
world of itself; I think of the affectionate parting
I have this day had with many warm friends, and
who are mostly priests, and of their sincere and
earnest entreaties for my speedy return to them;
and further, I think of the prospect of sowing the
word of God on my journey,—of the pleasure, if
such be the will of our Saviour, of seeing again
all my dear brethren and friends in England,—of
spending a few months with you in endeavours
to forward the cause of our Redeemer in South
America; and finally, I think of parting from you
once more, and of returning again to this quarter
of the world, to spend in it the remaining days of my
life in seeking its welfare.</p>

<p>It is time to tell you the immediate cause of
these projected movements. I say the <em>immediate</em>
cause, for I suppose you know that these are not
new arrangements. The reason, then, of my setting
off at the present time is, because I conceive it the
most favourable time I am likely to have of reducing
these arrangements to practice. You know
how the war rages here, and how it defeats every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
attempt to forward the education of youth, and the
promoting of general improvement. What I have
said applies to Peru in general, but more particularly
to this city, where the sword has truly reached
to the heart. We are here, I may say, in a beseiged
city, having the enemy on all sides. Guerilla
parties surround the city by land, and have
several times come in at night, and carried off
people and property; and on the other hand the
port of Callao is actually blockaded by the Peruvian
squadron under Admiral Guise. The distress
which prevails in this city, in consequence of every
thing being thus at a stand, is <em>very great</em>, and it
is augmented by heavy contributions. This, perhaps,
in former times, was, without exception,
the richest city in the world, but <em>now</em>, I may say
with equal certainty, that it is the poorest. The
luxury and dissipation which prevailed, in consequence
of this abundance of wealth, may be
easily imagined; and I have often thought upon
that passage in the 18th chapter of the Revelation,
and have seen it applied, I think, to our case,
“How much she hath glorified herself, and lived
deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give
her.”</p>

<p>Until, therefore, some change take place here,
nothing more can be done than has already been
done. Our school goes on, and I may say, with as
much prosperity as could be expected under the
circumstances above mentioned. The number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
scholars has decreased from 230 to about 200.
There are two causes for this decrease; the one is,
that the bigger boys are afraid to go out lest they
should be taken up by the recruiting parties; and
the other is, the real poverty which exists, and
which prevents many parents from sending their
children, as they are unable to procure them shoes
and clothes to enable them to appear decently
among others. Whilst these two causes exist, the
number may diminish, perhaps, still more, but the
school will continue to maintain itself, and to support
its character, I expect, in the progress of those
who attend. There are two masters in it, who are
well instructed in the plan, and the whole is under
the direction of my good friend, the clergyman, of
whom I have often spoken to you. What I have
said applies to the model or central school. There
is also another school in the city on the same plan,
with about eighty scholars, which, I hope, will also
continue to go on well, though subject, of course,
to the same disadvantages.</p>

<p>I have thought, then, that I was called upon to
seize this time as the most suitable for visiting
other parts of this Continent, and for the objects I
have in England. My principal business upon my
journey will be the circulation of the Scriptures in
the different places I may visit, and I hope that
something may be done in this way, so as to make
my journey not unprofitable. Of my progress on
my road, and in my objects, I shall endeavour to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
inform you from time to time. I shall only farther
observe, in regard to my intentions, that my route,
&amp;c. will be a good deal determined by the circumstances
which may occur in the way by which the
Lord may lead me.</p>

<p>These movements have, I trust, been entered
upon in the fear of God, and after mature deliberation,
and fervent supplication to the Father of
lights, who has promised to guide in judgment those
who seek his face in sincerity.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Guayaquil, 5th October, 1824.</i></p>

<p>I arrived in this place a few days ago, and
seize the earliest opportunity to state to you the
cause of my being here. You already know that
the single object which I have in view in South
America, is the promoting of the kingdom of our
Lord Jesus Christ. There are, of course, various
ways of doing this, and I have thought it best to
allow myself to be guided in the manner of doing
it, by the various circumstances and occasions
which the providence of God opens up to me
from time to time. The two things to which I
have more particularly given my attention all
along are, the education of youth, and the circulation
of the Holy Scriptures. In regard to
the latter, with which you are more immediately
connected, I have stated to the Society, at different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
times, my desire of forwarding their work in this
quarter, in every way which lies in my power.
I have also informed the Society, on various occasions,
as to the progress of their work in this
continent. It has afforded me much satisfaction to
observe the interest taken by you all for supplying
South America with the sacred volume, and to read
the repeated assurances you have communicated
to me of your desire to carry forward this object
in the most extensive and effectual way possible.
The confidence I reposed in the Society in regard
to this country, induced me to commence the
translation of the New Testament on your account
into the Quichua, or ancient language of Peru,
and the answer I received from you some time
ago, has shown me that I was not mistaken in
regard to your views.</p>

<p>The same confidence as to the views of the
Society, and a hope of being able to do something
in the way of circulating the word of God, in places
not yet visited, or but very partially, by this
messenger of peace, has induced me to come to
this city at the present time. It is my intention
to set out from this place in two or three days for
Bogotá, the capital of Colombia. In my way
I shall pass through Riobamba, Ambato, Tacunga,
Quito, and Popayan, all of which are populous
cities, and where I expect to sell a considerable
number of copies of the Spanish New Testaments.</p>

<p>The present state of the war in Lima renders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
abortive every attempt to forward education there,
and very little can be done in the circulation of
the Scriptures by sale, on account of the very
great pressure of the war, which has reduced the
city to much distress. Under these circumstances,
I thought the best time I could find for visiting
the quarters above mentioned, and perhaps for
visiting my native land, was the present. I set
out then from Lima with this intention, and to
perform the part of an agent of the British and
Foreign Bible Society. I am not sure, but I may
feel myself under the necessity of petitioning you for
my <em>travelling expenses</em>. I never intended to charge
you for any services I might be honoured in doing
for your Society, if possible to avoid it; but the
low state of my funds at present, on account of
the war here, may urge me to do what otherwise
I should not have done. I mention this at present,
only in case it should be necessary. The
prosperous turn the war has lately taken in Peru,
encourages me to hope that what is due to me by the
government of that country will be paid in due
time, and in that case my little services shall cost
you nothing.</p>

<p>I left Lima on the 5th ultimo, and at that time
the supply of New Testaments, and of the four books
of the Old Testament, printed with a small type,
of which you wrote me, had not arrived. I had
anxiously looked for their arrival for some weeks
before my coming away, as by the date of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
letter, I thought there was sufficient time for their
reaching that place. I was very sorry in not
having been furnished with this supply before
entering upon my present journey, as I think the
volumes printed with the small type would have
been very acceptable, and the whole Bible also
would have been equally so, as it has been often
sought for. I have just one Bible with me to show
as I go along, by way of specimen, in order to
incite curiosity, and a desire to possess it, when
it may be supplied to all those places. This copy
I bought in Lima for this express purpose, and
hope it will serve the end in view. I have brought
about 800 New Testaments with me, and in this
place I have found the supply you sent by the
Grecian to Mr. Lynch, and which I thought had
gone to Chile. I am glad at finding these here,
as it enables me to send a quantity to Guatemala
by an opportunity which offers from this
place in a day or two. The rest I will dispose
of otherwise. I mentioned to you some time ago,
that I had sent two boxes to Guatemala of those
which came to me by the Grecian. I have however
learned, that the vessel in which they were
sent had changed her destination, and that they
have not yet arrived at that place. The accidental
finding, in this place, the cases brought by
the Grecian, enables me now to supply this deficiency,
and also to send by the same person a
supply to California. As to the boxes formerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
sent, though they did not arrive at the destination
intended, I entertain no doubt of their safety, and
of their being profitably disposed of somewhere,
and of which I expect to hear in due time.</p>

<p>I shall now state to you what has occurred in
the part of my journey already performed. The
first object I had in view, was to visit Truxillo,
where I expected to find my good friends who
take so much interest in the Peruvian translation
of the New Testament, and who had laboured
so diligently to accomplish it. I accordingly embarked
on board a vessel bound for that place,
and where I safely arrived in due time. I was
sadly disappointed in not finding my friends there
as I expected. Not one of them was to be found,
nor could I ascertain with certainty where they
were, but heard that one had been seen going to
one place and another to another. The suddenness
of their leaving Lima prevented us from making
any arrangements about our translation, and we
had not even time to bid each other adieu. The
abruptness of our parting, rendered more severe
my disappointment in not finding them in Truxillo,
where I intended to make arrangements with
them for carrying forward thin work during my
absence. I had brought from Lima the manuscript
of the whole New Testament in the Quichua
language, together with the Gospel of Luke,
thoroughly revised and prepared for the press. I
mentioned to you in my last, that I would endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to carry your resolution into effect regarding the
printing of 1,000 copies of this revised part. I
mentioned also that all the printing presses had
been removed from Lima, but that two were to
be found in Callao, and that I would ascertain
whether the work in question could be done there.
Upon enquiry, I found it could not. In consequence
of this, I wished to get the Gospel of
Luke printed in Truxillo, and for that end carried
the MS. to that place, that it might be carried
through the press there. And in regard to the
MS. of the other parts of the New Testament,
I expected that our friends, in their exile, might
go on revising and correcting it. All these plans,
as you see, have been frustrated. I therefore carefully
packed up the whole MS. and addressing it
to one of our translators, gave it into the hands
of an English gentleman going to Lima, to be
delivered according to the address, when the expulsion
of the Spaniards from Lima (which is
soon expected) would enable our friends to return.
I also wrote a few lines explaining my wish regarding
the revising of the MS., and regarding
the printing of the part already revised. The
English gentleman of whom I have spoken, has
kindly offered to advance all the money that may
be necessary for carrying this into effect. From
these arrangements I expect that the work will
be set agoing again in the course of two, or at
most three months from this date; for according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
to the <em>present</em> aspect of the war, the Spaniards
will not be able to continue longer in possession
of Lima, although they may, and probably
will, retain the fortresses of Callao till a later
period.</p>

<p>Having touched upon this subject of the Spanish
cause here, I cannot forbear mentioning to you the
singular interposition of Providence on behalf of
the cause of liberty in this quarter. On the 6th
of August last the two armies came in sight of
each other at a place called Junin, between Pasco
and Tarma. The consequence was, that a battle
took place between the cavalry of the two parties.
There were 1,200 of the Spaniards and 800 of the
Patriots. An eye witness says, “The concussion
was tremendous, as they came up to each other at
full gallop. In a quarter of an hour, upwards of
400 men lay dead upon the field, more than three-fourths
of whom were Royalists. All this havoc
and slaughter was caused by the lance and sword,
principally by the former. Not a shot of any
description, was fired.” In a short time victory
begin visibly to declare for the Spaniards, and the
General at the head of the patriot cavalry was
made prisoner. At this critical moment, by some
scarcely explained movement, the Spaniards got
somehow into disorder, and began to give way.
This was followed up by the Patriots, and in
a very short time they obtained a complete victory.
The whole of the Spanish army was, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
consequence of this defeat, struck with a panic, and
by forced marches endeavoured to get out of the
way of the enemy as fast as possible. Bolivar immediately
advanced, and the Spaniards continued
to flee before him with all speed. On the 22d
August, only 15 days after the battle, the advanced
guard of the patriot army entered Guamanga.
Five of the finest provinces of Peru thus fell into
their hands in the short period of about a fortnight.
The Spanish army has been sadly reduced and
dispirited by their rapid retreat, and the army of
Bolivar has increased in numbers and in strength.
I consider this to be <em>a deadly blow</em> to the Spanish
cause in this quarter of the world, from which I
think and hope they will never recover. With
this cause will terminate, I trust, the reign of
oppression and violence, of ignorance and fanaticism
in Peru, and by which it has been borne down
for these three hundred years. So perish all
tyranny and ignorance from the earth!</p>

<p>I should perhaps beg your pardon for having
drawn your attention so long to the concerns of war
and of politics, as you are men of peace and of no
party, and your only occupation is speaking peace
to them who are far off and to them that are nigh.
Still, however, you will remember that the book
whose circulation we are engaged in, detains our
attention in many places with the account of wars
and revolutions. But you will say that all these
are related there merely from their being connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
with the grand moral and religious revolution of
the world through that great prophet who was to
come. This is certainly a right view of the
subject; and motives of a similar nature, I trust,
and not party nor malicious principles, have induced
me to detain you a moment upon the wars of this
quarter of the world. I firmly believe that the
deliverance of this country from bondage and
oppression, and the mental emancipation of its
inhabitants, depend upon the success of this revolution.
The Spaniards, as is well known, have
greatly impeded, not to say prohibited, the progress
of knowledge and of true religion in America.
It is not easy therefore, nor is it proper, to remain
indifferent as to the issue of this struggle.</p>

<p>I now return to our work of peace, and to Truxillo.
I wrote the Society some time ago, of having
found a useful and zealous co-labourer in that city,
and that I had forwarded to him from Lima a
supply of New Testaments. At the first he met
with some difficulties, owing to the ecclesiastical
authorities of the place. These were at length
overcome, and he was allowed to commence the
sale of the Scriptures publicly. When he had
obtained leave to do so, he printed an advertisement,
and posted it up in the public places of the
town, intimating the sale. The consequence was,
that he had sold when I was there about 100
copies. He had also written to his friends the Vicars
in the provincial towns, but he had not then, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the shortness of the time, received the answers
to his letters. When these arrive, he expects several
orders for New Testaments to be sent to the
various towns in the department of Truxillo, which
contains a population of upwards of 300,000. In
addition to this mode of circulating the Scriptures,
my friend informed me that he was about to put
in practice a method of lending the New Testaments
in the different houses which he is in the
habit of visiting, and in others which he intends
to visit for that purpose. Our friend’s medical
duties give him a facility for carrying this into
practice. He intends to lend the New Testament
for a day, or for two or three days, as circumstances
may direct, and to call again for it
himself at the given time. Upon calling for it,
he says he will ask them if they wish to purchase
it, and if so, he will sell it at a price corresponding
to the circumstances of the individual; and if they
do not wish it, he will take it with him and lend
it to some other, to whom in turn he will put the
same question, and thus sell it or take it with him,
as circumstances require. You will easily see
that this way of doing will cost him a good deal
of labour and care, but he seems to count nothing
of these, if in this manner he may be the means
of circulating the word of God, and of drawing
the attention of the people around him, to its all-important
contents. As he makes all his rounds
on horseback, he will, I hope, be enabled fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
to verify his benevolent purpose. He showed me
a pair of saddle-bags, which he told me he had
got made for the very purpose of always carrying
about with him a supply of New Testaments. He
gave me one hundred dollars to account of sales,
which was rather more than what he had received.</p>

<p>The next thing I have to notice in Truxillo,
is, I conceive, of some importance, and will prove,
I trust, the means of greatly extending the operations
and diffusing the blessings of the British and
Foreign Bible Society. What I refer to is, the
finding of an additional agent who takes a lively interest
in the diffusion of the Scriptures, and in every
other means by which his countrymen may be benefited.
The individual in question is a clergyman,
and a man of rank in that order. He is Vicar-general
to the army, and possesses a considerable
influence. His residence, at present, is at Moche,
a little village about four or five miles from Truxillo,
and of which place he is rector. This, however,
is only a temporary residence, during the occupation
of his home by the Spaniards, and from
which, in consequence, he was obliged to flee. The
place of his nativity and of his permanent residence
is in the province and near the city of Arequipa,
towards the southern extremity of Peru. It is this
circumstance in particular, that will render his
services valuable, as we have already an active
agent in Truxillo. He intends to return to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
native province as soon as the course of the war will
permit. Arequipa is in the centre of a populous
country, and he will have an extensive field of
operation. Another circumstance renders the acquisition
of this gentleman very valuable, and that
is his thorough knowledge of the Indian or Peruvian
language, which is very extensively spoken in
that quarter. To this I add another feature in his
character of yet more importance, which is, his
compassion for the oppressed and degraded state of
the indigenous population of Peru, and the lively
interest he takes in ameliorating their condition, by
his representations to the government upon the
subject, and by his personal labours. No individual
I have yet met with in these countries, has
offered himself so decidedly and so heartily to promote
the cause of your Society, as this gentleman;
and from all the circumstances I have mentioned,
you will see that his good will and his services
must be considered a great acquisition.</p>

<p>I considered the time spent in visiting Truxillo
abundantly recompensed in meeting with this
fellow-labourer, and I found, in this circumstance,
some relief from the disappointment I had met with
in not finding there the friends I had expected.
My falling in too with that individual was perfectly
accidental, for I had no knowledge of such a
one being in that place. But then again we must
remember, that “all chance is but direction which
we cannot see.” Blessed be God who leadeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
us by ways <em>we</em> know not, but which <em>he</em> knows,
and which will lead us to the glorifying of his
name, when that is our object. I must not omit to
give you the name and address of our fellow-labourer.
It is “Dr. Don Manuel Fernandez de
Córdova, Vicario General del Ejército del Peru, y
Cura de Salamanca del Obispado de Arequipa.”
I have given you this address in Spanish to enable
you to write direct to our friend, should you feel
so inclined.</p>

<p>I shall now leave Truxillo, but before I go on
board, shall just notice a little incident. Truxillo
is about six miles distant from Huanchaco, which
is the sea port town of that quarter. In going
down to this port, I happened to get a very bad
horse, which soon becoming restive, I was obliged
to leave it at a house upon the road, and to walk
down under a burning sun. After I had walked
more than half the way, a person came riding up
to me and offered me a horse, which of course I
accepted. He told me he had observed me on
foot from a distance, and had pushed forward to
offer me assistance. Upon entering into conversation
I found my obliging friend was a peasant,
belonging to a neighbouring village, where he had
a family to which he was returning. We spoke
a little about education in general, and of his
family in particular. I learned from him that
he could read, and was anxious that his children
should be well instructed. I asked him if he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
ever seen the New Testament, to which he replied
in the negative, and from less to more, he intimated
to me that he would be glad to purchase one if
he could find it, for the use of himself and of his
children. When we arrived at Huanchaco, he
would accept of no remuneration for his kindness,
and as I found my luggage there not embarked,
I brought him a New Testament and made him
a present of it, in return for his unsolicited and
friendly attentions. He received it most thankfully,
and we parted.</p>

<p>On the 24th we sailed for Guayaquil, but as we
carried a gentleman with us at the request of the
government, we had to call at Paita to land him
there. We cast anchor in that port on the 26th,
after sun-set, and early next morning I went ashore
to see the place, and took three New Testaments
with me. I went into a store near the landing-place,
and being invited, took a seat upon a bale
of cotton. After some general conversation, I
opened my treasure, and offered the New Testaments
for sale at one dollar each, and in a few
minutes they were bought. Some little time after, I
was asked if I had any more. I replied that I
had, but that they were in the ship. I immediately
went on board, and just as we had got our anchor
up, a boat came along-side, in which I recognized
the person who had asked me for more New Testaments.
He came on board and bought two dozen,
for which he paid me eighteen dollars. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
we were by this time under way, the boat had
to return ashore without loss of time, whilst we,
with a most propitious gale, made for this port.—On
the evening of the 29th we cast anchor off the
small town of Puná, on the island of the same
name. You will remember that this island is
famous in the conquest of Peru, by the Spaniards.
According to the accounts of it that remain,
it seems to have been very populous at that time.
It is not so now. There is, on the whole island,
only one little village, namely, the one I have
mentioned, and which does not contain above 200
inhabitants. We landed at this little place for
a pilot to conduct us up the river. I took with
me, as I had done at Paita, three New Testaments.
When we landed, we found some people
on the beach, to whom we communicated intelligence
of the rapid progress of Bolivar. We
were invited into one of the houses, and after
having talked a little upon various subjects, I
opened my casket and presented my New Testaments,
which they were all very curious to see.
Whilst they were looking through them, one of the
neighbours came in. “Here!” said one who was
examining the New Testament, “here is a book
that will tell you about the beginning of the world,
and a great many other things.” His friend replied,
that he cared very little about the <em>beginning</em>
of the world, but that he wished to know something
about the <em>end of it</em>. Upon hearing this, I told him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
that the book he had in his hands was the very
book that would suit him, as it would inform him
particularly about the end of the world. I sold
the three New Testaments in this same house, and
as our captain had by this time made arrangements
with the pilot, we got on board again, and set sail.
On the following night (the 30th) we arrived at
this place, at eight o’clock. Before we cast
anchor, an English gentleman came on board, to
whom I had a letter of introduction. He kindly
invited me to his house, where I am comfortably
lodged, and from which I now write you.</p>

<p>I intend to stop in this place only a few days,
during which I shall endeavour to dispose of as
many New Testaments as I can, and in the way
that may be most profitable. I now close this
letter, and shall inform you of the success I meet
with here, in my next communication.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Guayaquil, 11th October, 1824.</i></p>

<p>My letter of the 5th current will inform you of
the motives and objects which have brought me to
this place. It will also inform you of what progress
I have made in the circulation of the Holy
Scriptures, and in objects connected therewith,
from my leaving Lima till my arrival in this
quarter. I proceed, therefore, to state to you the
occurrences of Guayaquil in reference to these
matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Some time ago, and of which I believe I informed
you, I sent from Lima twenty New Testaments
to a Gentleman here, to be sold at one
dollar each, if opportunities should offer, of disposing
of them among his friends. This gentleman
holds a principal situation in the government, and
had been recommended to me by a relation of his
in Truxillo, as a person desirous of doing good.
Upon my arriving here, I called upon him, and
found him to be a person worthy of the honourable
appellation just mentioned. He told me he had
disposed of the New Testaments, and he gave me
twenty dollars which he had received for them.</p>

<p>As soon as I had reached this place, I mentioned
to some persons that I had a supply of New Testaments
for sale, and in consequence I sold one
hundred and sixty-eight copies. After thinking
for some time upon what would be the speediest and
most effectual way of disposing of the New Testaments,
it occurred to me that the best thing I
could do would be to print an advertisement, and to
give notice of the sale by posting these up in the
public places of the different towns I pass through
on my journey. This, you will see, would at
once draw the attention of the <em>public</em>. The only
objection that occurred to me was, that it would
be a kind of challenge to our opponents, or at least
an intimation of our hostile operations. This
obstacle I kept in mind, but did not think our adversaries
would be able to make any effectual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
resistance. More powerful, I believe, are those
who are for us than those who are against us. The
encouragement to make such an attempt as this,
arises from the great and happy changes already
effected by the revolution going on in this country,
and, I trust, now concluding. I could not have
ventured upon such a thing under the Spanish
government. What is going forward in these
countries is truly a <em>revolution</em> in every sense of the
word.</p>

<p>I accordingly wrote out an advertisement, and
got it printed in the government printing-office
in this place. Translated into English it runs
thus: “To be sold in (<i>a</i>) the New Testament
of our Lord Jesus Christ, in one volume, well
printed, and neatly bound, at the low price of
<em>eight</em> rials. This sale will continue for (<i>b</i>) days
only, and it is expected that those who wish to
procure for themselves this sacred code of our Holy
Religion, will improve the occasion now offered
them.” As this advertisement was intended not
for this place alone, but for others also, I left
the blank (<i>a</i>) to be filled up with the pen to suit
each place, and the blank (<i>b</i>) I leave for the number
<i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, or <i>three</i>, as my time will permit, and
as the importance of the town visited may require.
When these notices were finished, I caused some
to be put up in this place, saying that the sale
would be for <em>three</em> days only. In a few minutes
after putting them up, I enjoyed the great satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
of seeing it produce much better effects than
I had anticipated. At <em>noon</em> the notices were put
up and at <em>one o’clock</em> I had sold <em>fifteen</em> copies. In
the next hour I sold <em>forty-seven</em>. In the course of
an hour and a half during the time the store was
open in the afternoon, I sold <em>one hundred and twelve</em>.
Next day I sold 262 copies. The day following,
which was also one of the three days of sale, happened
to be a festival day held to celebrate the declaration
of independence in this town four years ago. The
stores in consequence were all shut, and public
business suspended. Nevertheless, there were
<em>eleven</em> copies sold during a few minutes before
breakfast, when the store was open for some particular
purpose. To-day I set out on my
journey to Quito, bu I may perhaps sell some
before I go, as I cannot go off before four o’clock
in the afternoon, having to sail up the river with
the flood tide.</p>

<p>The whole number disposed of in this place
is 615, and for these I have received 542 dollars
2 rials.—The greater part were sold one by one at
eight rials each, but sometimes I sold a dozen or
two together, and in that case sold them somewhat
cheaper. To the number of copies already mentioned,
I add the 30 disposed of, as noticed in my
last, and three copies sold in Truxillo of those in
superior binding, making in all 648 copies since
the commencement of my tour. To the amount of
monies received in the same time as above, I add,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
what I received from Dr. O’Donovan, from the
gentleman here as previously mentioned, and for
those sold in Paita and Puná, and the three just
noticed, making 153 dollars, amounting in all to
695 dollars 2 rials. Of this sum, I have remitted
500 dollars to Messrs. Cochran and Robertson, of
Lima, with whom I keep my accounts. This sum
will be applied to carrying forward the translation
and printing of the Scriptures into the <em>Peruvian</em>
language, agreeably to your resolution upon the
subject, communicated to me some time ago.</p>

<p>Need I add anything to the above by way of
comment or observation? Is it not most gratifying
to see so many seeds sown in this town? Let us
join together in prayer, that He who causeth the
rain to descend from heaven to fertilize the ground,
and to raise into fruit the puny efforts of man, may
cause his blessing to be upon the seed sown in this
place. As it is sown in weakness may it be raised
in strength, and produce at least a hundred fold.</p>

<p>P.S.—<i>12th October.</i>—Our boat did not sail
yesterday, and thus gave me the opportunity of
adding 71 to the number of copies formerly mentioned,
and 71 dollars to account.</p>

<p>The preceding sentence was written in the morning,
and now, in the afternoon, I add 52 copies
more, making in all, in Guayaquil, 738.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Guaranda, 25th October, 1824.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to you was written in Guayaquil
on the 12th instant. On that occasion I noticed
that I had taken that freedom with you in regard to
writing, which we often take with our friends without
the danger or the thought of offending on the
one hand or on the other. The letter referred to
was short and could not well be longer from the
circumstances in which I was then placed. Before
I had finished it, the master of the canoe in which
I was to leave Guayaquil, had knocked at the
door according to appointment, at four o’clock in
the morning. Although, however, that letter was
short, I did not consider that I had left you uninformed
as to the circumstances that had occurred
during my journey from Lima to Guayaquil, as
well as those that had occurred in the place
last mentioned. I wrote upon that subject two
letters of some length, to the British and Foreign
Bible Society, detailing these matters with some
degree of minuteness. Of these two letters I requested
Mr. B. to forward you copies, and doubt
not that such will be forwarded to you immediately
upon their arrival.</p>

<p>In the two letters referred to, I stated the measures
I had taken in circulating the Scriptures in
Guayaquil, and the unexpected and happy results
which followed in the sale of 738 copies of the
New Testament. It was gratifying, I assure you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
to see in this manner almost the whole city come together
to hear the word of God, and it was not less
so, to pass along the streets and to count one, two,
three, a dozen perhaps, diligently engaged in reading
their New Testaments. Who could pass along under
such circumstances, in any other frame than that of
thanksgiving and prayer?—thanksgiving to God
for having disposed so many to attend to the things
which belong to their everlasting peace, and which
I may say, have been hitherto hid from their eyes,—and
prayer, that the eyes of their understanding
might be enlightened, that they might be turned
from darkness to light, and might enjoy that inheritance
which the Lord hath prepared for them
that love him. Nor could I feel otherwise, nor
withhold from expressing those feelings, as I
walked over the spot where sin has deposited his
spoils won in that place. The small and the great
are there. My prayer to God was, that through
means of the word of life then circulated, many
from that spot might, at the voice of the Archangel,
awake to life and everlasting glory.</p>

<p>We read in the sacred page upon a certain occasion,
some thousands of years ago, when the sons of
God came to present themselves before him, Satan
came also among them. The same seems to have
been his practice in Jerusalem, in Antioch, in Philippi,
as well as upon other occasions of ancient
and modern date. That he was not absent
on this occasion in Guayaquil, we may <i>a priori</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
assured of. That he was successful, however, I
have not yet learned. I did, indeed, overhear that
some priest had said something against the reading
of the New Testament, but I had some suspicion
that the information was not quite correct. As a
counterpart to this, several priests and friars bought
of the New Testaments. At one time, I think
there were <em>five</em> friars in the store at one time to
purchase, and one of these took <em>thirteen</em> copies.
At another time, a friar, who had bought a New
Testament, came afterwards inquiring very anxiously
for the whole Bible, and was much disappointed
upon learning that there was none. I told him
that some two months after, some Bibles might be
expected, and that as only 50 copies were ordered,
he had better put down his name if he wished to
secure one for himself. Upon my telling him so,
he immediately subscribed for <em>two</em> copies. This
person told me that all the friars in his convent
had bought New Testaments, and that they
were all highly pleased with them. It is really
encouraging to see the word of God circulate in this
quarter with little or no opposition.—I may add
further regarding this matter, that I was upon very
good terms with the rector of Guayaquil during the
few days I remained there. I paid him a visit,
accompanied by a friend to introduce me, and next
day I received a very courteous visit from him in
return, accompanied by the ecclesiastic next in
rank to himself. He has, besides, given me two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
letters of introduction, warmly recommending me to
his friends in Quito. Do not all these things, my
dear friend, lay us under obligations to give thanks
unto him in whose hands are the hearts of all? And
are not such occurrences calculated to encourage
us to labour in this sacred cause and to ask of the
Lord <em>liberal things</em> according to his promise? I
am persuaded you so feel, and so act, but still it is
not unnecessary to remind you of these matters, to
stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance,
and thus to add line upon line. Let us then continue
instant in prayer, that the Lord would pour
out his blessing upon this country, already white
unto harvest.</p>

<p>A little after four o’clock on the morning of
the 14th, I got into the canoe which was to conduct
me from Guayaquil to Babahoyo. The river
Guayaquil is navigable at all seasons as far as the
latter place, a distance of about 40 miles, and in
the rainy season, when the river is high, boats pass
some 15 miles farther up. The navigation is performed
in balsas, and in large and small canoes.
The small canoes are made of a single tree hollowed
out, and the large ones are built like our
boats, and capable of carrying several tons, but
made in the shape of the small canoes. It was
in one of the large ones I took my passage to
Babahoyo. It is in general by no means a pleasant
voyage that is made between these two places.
On the one hand, the heat is very great; and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the other, the mosquitos are numerous and active.
The effects arising from the bite of this troublesome
insect are still, at the distance of more than a
week, very visible on my hands, and also on my
legs, where they were defended by the stocking
only. On the first day, owing to the excessive
heat, I felt very unwell, but enjoyed good health
on the following day. On this occasion I experienced
from some of my fellow-passengers those
friendly and soothing attentions which adorn the
female character, and which, on several occasions,
I have seen exhibited in regard to myself and to
others during my residence in this country. We
were nearly three days in our passage. The river
<em>abounds</em> with alligators. I might almost say, it
is <em>full</em> of them. Great numbers lie basking on
the banks with their horrible mouths wide open,
and upon coming close up to them they plunge into
the river, and swim about like so many logs floating
around you. At one time I counted, in a very
short distance, all at one view, on one side of the
river, to the number of forty, and at another time
I saw twenty, close together. Very few are found
at or below Guayaquil, as the water is salt for
some miles above the town. In the rainy season,
however, when the great quantity of fresh water
keeps the salt water down below the town, the
alligator is found farther down. I made several
inquiries as to the feeling of this animal towards
man in this quarter, but could not get any well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
authenticated information of its seizing upon human
kind, and the frequency of bathing in the
river speaks the same language. It seems, in
this river, still to observe that fear and regard to
man which all the animal creation once possessed,
but which has now in regard to several animals
been effaced, and in most cases, I believe, through
the cruelty of man towards the animal creation.
All accounts, however, agreed in affirming that the
alligators here often seize upon hogs, and other
small animals, when found close to the river.
Whilst speaking upon this subject I may also notice,
that in all the low lands between the sea and
the mountains in the parts subject to periodical
rains, lions, tigers, and serpents abound, particularly
the latter. The lions I am told do not attack
man, nor does the serpent, except when trode
upon.</p>

<p>Many topics of conversation occurred during our
passage up the river. The sale of our New Testaments
was known to every body, and thus afforded
a subject of conversation in which we
could all take a part. Of course I had also something
to say upon this subject, as it was well known
that I was the seller of them. Two copies were
on board, one of which had been purchased by
the captain of our canoe, and the other by one
of the passengers. I have already told you of the
evangelical aspect of the streets of Guayaquil,
and the same aspect at times was exhibited on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
board, both of the New Testaments being frequently
in use at the same time. During the
many things that were said, arising from what was
read, (the reading being frequently aloud,) a conversation
took place, the relation of which will
probably interest you, and more especially as it
affords a specimen of the progress of <em>thinking</em> upon
religious subjects in this country. The subject
was a delicate one, but so much the better, as a
specimen. The worship of saints was the matter
treated of, though I do not remember what gave
rise to it. I stated my views upon the subject,
appealing to the Scriptures and to common sense
in support of my opinion. A very keen and interesting
conversation immediately took place, in
which four, besides myself, took a part, and you
will be surprised when I tell you that three of
the four took my side of the question. The one
who was opposed to us happened to be a stout
disputant, and thus gave occasion to a thorough
discussion of the matter. Among other things
brought forward to show the incongruity and sinfulness
of the worshipping of saints, I stated that
the Apostle Peter himself, (who according to them
is the prince of Apostles and saints,) refused this
worship, and in proof of this, I referred him to
the tenth chapter of the Acts. This passage was
turned up and read by one of the company, and
it appeared to all of us, except one, conclusive
upon the subject. Our opponent, however, defended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
himself, by alleging that although Peter,
upon that occasion, refused worship, he refused
it because he was not glorified, but that after death
things were otherwise.—You agree then, I remarked,
that worship is not to be given to the
saints when upon earth, but it is lawful, you say,
to give this worship to them after their death.
Let us then go to another passage, I said, and
see who of the inhabitants of heaven are to be
worshipped. I then referred to the last chapter
of the Revelation, namely, “When I had heard
and seen, I fell down before the feet of the angel
who showed me these things. Then saith he unto
me, See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant,
and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who
keep the sayings of this book: <em>Worship God</em>.”
This passage cut off the refuge which our friend
had taken in his distinction between worshipping a
saint on earth, and a saint in heaven. He then
took refuge in <em>the church</em>, alleging that since authority
had been given to it by Jesus Christ to order
and direct the concerns of his kingdom after his
ascension, it was our duty to obey its orders, and
one of these orders was, the praying to the saints.
You know, of course, how <em>I</em> would have got rid of
this objection, that is, by sweeping away this authority
of the church altogether, and I stated this to
be my opinion. The captain of our canoe, who
took a large share in the conversation, and who
saw in the church an authority to which he considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
himself bound to submit, assailed our opponent
by another argument, and a very effectual
one. He came close up to him, and with an air of
having something in his mind worth saying, “Is it
not,” said he, “the duty of children to reverence
their parents, and to obey them readily and constantly?”—“Certainly
it is,” replied his friend.
Our Captain continued: “And if a parent should
tell his child to steal, to lie, and such like things,
should the child obey?”—“Certainly not,” was the
reply. “You are right,” says the Captain, “and
that is just our case with the church. It is our
duty to obey it, as it is our duty to obey our
parents, but if our parents or the church bid us do
what is obviously wrong, in that case it is our duty
to <em>disobey</em>.” You see what an excellent argument
this was, and it completely silenced the other, and
left him without any thing to say upon the subject,
except mere general talk and repetition. Our
Captain having gained this triumph, turned to one
of the four, who seemed rather to acquiesce in the
strength of our arguments from the Scripture, than
zealously to defend our side, and put this question
to him. “Can you tell me,” said he, “why the
priest reads all the service and prays in Latin, a
language of which I do not understand a word, and
thus leaving me, when in church, as a mere statue,
without knowing what I am saying or doing?”
This was a hard question, and it was answered significantly,
but without words. Our Captain next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
comes up to me, and says, “You see every one sets
up his little machine to gain his dollar.” I thought
I understood his meaning, although couched under
a figure, but as I wished it to be well understood
by all, I asked him what he meant by it. After a
short delay he answered me, by stating, that the
church and the priests had made various laws and
ceremonies for their own benefit, and that they
might thus put a dollar into their pocket.—Various
other things were said, and among which the New
Testament was praised as a book any one might
read and understand, and not like the prayers of
the priests, which no one understood, perhaps not
themselves. One of the four alluded to, towards
the end of the conversation, said, in a very distinct
voice, and in the hearing of all, “If I were going
to die, this is my faith; I believe that there is one
God who made all things, and that there is one
Redeemer who died for us, and who rose again;
and as to the worshipping of saints, and all the
rest of it, I know nothing.” I should not omit an
observation of one of our female passengers. When
two of us were debating about the worship of saints,
she observed to me that she did not like such conversation.
Why so, I replied. Because, said
she, if saints are not to be worshipped, then it will
follow that we are not to pray to the Virgin Mary
neither. I said, in reply, that I thought her reasoning
worth being heard, as it was a fair deduction,
and requested her to put it in the form of a question,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
to the one of the four who appeared the coolest,
and who, as I said before, rather acquiesced in the
strength of our arguments than defended our side.
As soon as silence was obtained, the question was
put, and the answer returned was just what I
would have said if called upon to reply.</p>

<p>You will see in the whole of this conversation
a freedom of thinking and of speaking, which you
probably did not expect, and I confess that I was
myself greatly surprised at it, notwithstanding the
many opportunities I have had of observing the
sentiments of the people of this quarter. In the
higher and more enlightened classes of society, I
have often met with liberal sentiments, but as the
two persons who took the chief part in the above
conversation were of the lower class, it was both
new to me and interesting.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Babahoyo, I found lodgings
difficult to be procured, as the houses seemed all
occupied. As soon as this was known to one of
my fellow-passengers, he took me to his father’s
house, where I enjoyed comfortable bed and
board, kindly bestowed and free of expense, during
the two days I remained in that town. As I intended
to make no stay in this place, but push on,
I gave no public intimation regarding the sale of
New Testaments; yet, through means of my fellow-passengers
it came to be known that I had these
for sale, and in consequence I disposed of fifty-one
copies for which I received fifty dollars, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
copy being a present. I may mention, before
leaving this place, that it lies very low on the
banks of the river, and is overflowed in the rainy
season. The church stands upon a spot elevated
some feet above the surrounding parts; and I am
told it is common for the people in that season to
go up to the church door in their canoes. The
usual practice in passing from Babahoyo to Quito,
is to hire mules at the former place to Guaranda,
and again to hire anew from that to Quito. I
accordingly hired mules for this place, which cost
me five dollars each, on account of the badness of
the roads, though four dollars is the usual charge.
The weather at the present time is very unfavourable,
and it is singular to see it so at this season of
the year. I had counted upon fair weather in this
quarter during the whole time of my journey, according
to the information which I had obtained in
Lima, and am thus less prepared for rain than
otherwise I would have been had I expected it. I
may add also, that I like rain now worse than
ever, as during these two years past I have not
seen any. From Babahoyo to the base of the
mountains the roads were very deep and bad.
When we began to ascend the mountains, we found
ourselves still worse situated. The very steep ascent,
and the clayey slippery roads, rendered the
journey very unpleasant, and not a little dangerous
from the slipping of the mules, which were frequently
brought down upon their knees. I shall not detain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
you for the present with a minute account of the
journey to this place, suffice it to say, that I arrived,
here, the day before yesterday in the afternoon
in perfect health and safety; and I feel, I assure
you, upon looking back upon the road over which
I have passed, a new motive for thanksgiving to
the Father of mercies for my daily and hourly
preservation. I shall just farther add, as descriptive
of the mountains, that on the first day of our ascent,
the barometer in the valley, in the morning, stood
at 29.950, and where we lodged in the evening it
stood at 26.141, which indicates a great rise.
Where we lodged on the evening following it stood
at 22.085. On the next day we passed the highest
part of the ancient Indian road, where the
barometer stood at 21.322.</p>

<p>The situation of Guaranda, from which I now
write you, is about ten miles S. W. of the great
Chimborazo. This king of mountains raises its
majestic hoary head full in view. It is deeply
covered from the top, almost to the base, with everlasting
snow—snow which must have fallen, if not
in the days of Adam, at least in the days of
Noah. To-morrow I set off for Riobamba, when I
expect to have a fuller view of it, as the road passes
along it close to the skirts of its snowy mantle.
Guaranda contains about 1500 inhabitants, mostly
Indians, who all speak the ancient Peruvian language.
There are several little towns in the glens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
within the district, containing in all 14,000 inhabitants,
and who all speak the same language.
You will recollect that this is the language into
which the New Testament has lately been translated
in Lima, as mentioned in my former letters,
and you will see here a still more ample field of
usefulness for this translation, and the more so,
when I add, that not only in this district is the language
spoken, but also in all the towns in this
quarter as far as Quito. What a wonderful extent
and uniformity must the ancient Peruvian empire
have had. The inhabitants of this town and the
Indians of Peru have exactly the same features
and countenance, at well as language.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Riobamba, 31st October, 1824.</i></p>

<p>Soon after my arrival in the town of Guaranda,
I called upon the Governor, and made known to
him the object of my journey in this quarter. I
found him a man of intelligence, and a friend of
the British and Foreign Bible Society. Observing
him to be a person worthy of all confidence, and
very desirous of the instruction of his countrymen,
I made known to him, without reserve, the plans
and operations of the Bible Society, and that I
was travelling to forward its sacred object.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
He was much pleased with the brief view of the
Society which I gave him. He wished to see
the New Testaments, and became the first purchaser
himself. He also called upon those around to buy
for themselves, by telling them to come and learn to
be Christians from this book. I received many
friendly attentions from him during the two days I
remained in that place, and I think we formed
a kind of friendship which may contribute to
forward the objects of the Society in that quarter
on future occasions. Notwithstanding my printed
notices, and the encouragement of the Governor,
I sold but a very few copies in that place,
the whole number being thirteen. One cause of
there being so few sold is, that almost all the inhabitants
are Indians, and do not understand the
Spanish language, at all events cannot read it. To
which may be added the general apathy which
always exists in small towns. The few copies,
however, which have been circulated in that town,
will form a beginning (I may say of an era) in
that place, and will create a desire for more, both
there and in the villages around, when, on a future
occasion, some pilgrim from your Society shall
climb the Andes to visit their abode.</p>

<p>On the 29th I left Guaranda on my way to this
town. You will see by the map, that in visiting
Riobamba, I was going out of the straight road to
Quito, but I was anxious to visit this place, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
peradventure the Lord would incline the hearts of
some here, as in other places to receive the word
of God; and, generally speaking, my wish is to
pave the way for future operations, as well as to
drop a few seeds whilst so doing, and thus to be a
pioneer in your service, in the service of this people,
and, I trust, in the service of God. I told you
that Guaranda, and the villages around it, lay upon
the Andes; they are not, however, at the top, but
lie on the western side or declivity of the great
ridge, or Cordillera. After leaving Guaranda,
there is nearly a whole day’s climbing before you
reach the top. Upon reaching the highest parts of
the ridge, you have something like a plain, though
of no great extent; and out of this plain, or rather
this mountain, and from your very feet, rises the
great Chimborazo. From Guaranda we turned our
faces towards this great mountain, and began to
ascend. As we approached it, it began to frown,
and to forbid our drawing nearer. The rain, in a
little time, began to fall very heavily; we pushed
on; the hail succeeded, accompanied by vivid
lightning, whose rapid flight, from our elevated
situation, we could trace from heaven to earth. To
crown the whole, the loud thunder rolled along as
if Chimborazo were tumbling down upon us. To
pursue our journey, under such circumstances,
would have been foolish, and perhaps fatal. We
accordingly turned our backs upon the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
and began to descend, and to seek refuge in the
first hut we could come to. After some little time
we descried a thatched cottage, but we could not
reach it, as the descent to it from the ridge, along
which the road lay, was too rapid for our mules.
Another and another we had to pass in this way,
without being able to take shelter from the storm.
We at length found a house to which we could
descend, and I rode on towards it, and made inquiry
if we could be lodged there. I received an
answer in bad Spanish, saying, they did not understand
what I said. I was obliged, therefore,
to wait till the guide arrived, who understood the
Indian language, and upon his putting the same
question which I had put, we obtained refuge from
the storm, and found, in our circumstances, the
cottage converted into a palace.</p>

<p>I thus found myself in a cottage belonging to one
of the indigenous inhabitants of the country, and
had thus an opportunity of learning some things
which could not have been so well learned in any
other situation. I found that the inhabitants of
this hut understood only their native language; and
learned that this was the case with all the rural
inhabitants of these quarters. The language spoken
is that of Peru, into which, through your beneficence,
the New Testament has been translated,
and part of which will soon be printed. The need
of having the word of God translated into this language,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
is thus rendered more evident, and we see the
field to be watered by it increased.</p>

<p>Towards the evening the sky cleared up, and as
the sun was setting, the aspect around became
beautiful. I stepped to a little distance from the
cottage, and reached the road on the ridge which
we had left some hours before. As I walked backwards
and forwards in this spot, enjoying the serene
and peaceful evening, I felt gratitude rise in my
heart to the Father of mercies, for my protection
and shelter from the storm. I had just gone over
that beautiful hymn, of which the first and last
verses follow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When all thy mercies, O my God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My rising soul surveys;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Transported with the view, I’m lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In wonder, love, and praise.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through all eternity to Thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A joyful song I’ll raise;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, oh, eternity’s too short</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To utter all thy praise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I had just repeated this companion of my travels,
and was beginning to descend to the cottage, when
I observed a person coming up, mounted on a very
good horse, and leading another still better. I
wondered to see him bend his course to the uninhabited
mountains at such a late hour, and had
the curiosity to wait his approach, to make inquiry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
“Pray friend,” said I, “where can you be going
this way at so late an hour?”—“I am seeking you,”
was the reply.—“Seeking me!” I replied.
“Yes,” said he, “I have a letter for you from the
Governor of Guaranda.” I received and opened
the letter, and read, in the language of friendship,
that my good friend, dreading that I should be
worsted by the storm, had sent an excellent horse
for me, with orders to his servant to travel on until
he should find me, at whatever hour it might be,
and to see me safe in Riobamba. Whatever might
have been my feelings before, they were, at least,
now “lost in wonder, love, and praise.” I should
have mentioned, also, that the servant delivered me
a little basket, which I found to be filled with provisions
for our journey, and into which, also, the
hand of friendship itself had dropped a few sweet
cakes. All these things, under the circumstances in
which I found myself, had a powerful effect upon
my mind, and encouraged me anew to hope in
God and to persevere in his service.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we stepped down to the hut,
procured some provisions for the horses, some repast
for ourselves, and passed the night as comfortably
as we could. Early next morning we began to
prepare for our journey. I had given our hostess
a rial now and a rial then to give her confidence in
my honesty; for there is some distrust in regard to
provisions bestowed upon strangers, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
founded, I believe, on experience. Before setting
out, I paid her all her demands, and gave her a
little more; upon which she lifted up both her
hands, and prayed for a blessing upon me, and thus
we parted. After travelling for some time, Chimborazo
looked out from the clouds, the first appearance
of which, I confess, filled me with a kind of
dread, more especially as I thought it frowned
upon us again. As we went on, however, the day
brightened, and we reached the mountain in due
time, and took up our lodging in an uninhabited
house on the side of it. During my evening walk
the clouds entirely disappeared from the mountain,
and it seemed to sit down in beautiful splendour
beside me, and thus we became more than reconciled
to each other. Next morning the same beautiful
appearance was exhibited as we set out on our
way to Riobamba.</p>

<p>At mid day we reached this place, which contains
about 3000 inhabitants, with a considerable population
in the villages around. I called upon the
Governor, and presented him a letter of introduction
which I had brought from the Governor of
Guaranda. In this gentleman I also found a friend,
and an encourager of our object. He directed me
to the house of a friend, where I have a comfortable
lodging. Upon stating to him my object, and
showing him the advertisement which I wished to
fix up in the public parts of the town, he ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
his clerk to fill up the blanks according to my directions,
and then sent one of the Alguazils to put
them up. He bought six New Testaments himself,
and during the two days of my stay here, I
have disposed of 35 copies. To-morrow I set out
for Ambato, accompanied by a soldier, which the
Governor has ordered to attend me by way of a
guide and a guard. Considering the shortness of
my stay here, and considering that many more
New Testaments would have been bought had time
been afforded, I thought it advisable to leave 50
copies in the hands of the Governor, who kindly
undertook to dispose of them as circumstances
offered. For the same reason I left 50 copies with
him to be forwarded by the first opportunity to the
Governor of Guaranda. I have also had another
object in view in doing so, and that is to convert,
as it were, these individuals into members and
agents of your Society, the importance of which
you will at once see.</p>

<p>I have already noticed to you that the rural
inhabitants of the district of Guaranda speak the
Indian language only. The same also may be said
of all the districts in this quarter, as far as Quito,
I formerly stated to you, that in Peru a million of
souls stood in need of the translation of the Scriptures
into the Quichua language, and you now see
how many thousands more may be added to this
number. I have no doubt but the importance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the translation in question will lead you to extend
your beneficence to the translating and printing of
the whole Scriptures into this language. When I
find persons, particularly clergymen, with whom I
can communicate with confidence, I state to them
what has been done in regard to this translation,
and the use that may be made of it in instructing
the indigenous inhabitants of this quarter, which is
by far the most numerous class of the population.
To such individuals I mention, also, the happy effects
produced by the schools in the Gaelic and
Irish languages. I have succeeded in convincing
many of the importance and practicability of educating
the native population, and am much encouraged
by the interest I find taken in this matter, by
many persons of name and influence in the places
I have visited. In this town, the prior of one of
the convents, and the rector of the town, have promised
to forward this object as far as lies in their
power, and on my part I have promised to forward
them some copies of this translation as soon us they
are ready.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is great cause for thanksgiving,
in seeing the Scriptures meet with so ready
a reception in this quarter, and the more so when
we consider that this is the first time this treasure
has been offered them. Let us pray that the word
of God may have free course in this place, and
that it may be glorified.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Quito, 8th November, 1824.</i></p>

<p>Through the tender mercies of the Lord I
arrived in this city yesterday morning in health and
safety. The same gracious hand who has guided
me hitherto has provided for me a lodging in this
place, in the house of the Marquis de San José,
where I enjoy all the comforts that kindness and
plenty can bestow. My last letter to you was
dated the 31st ultimo, from Riobamba, and detailed
the various circumstances that occurred in my
journey from Guayaquil to that place. It now remains
for me, therefore, to state the particulars of
my journey from Riobamba until my arrival in this
city.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 1st current, I set
out for Ambato, and arrived there safely in the afternoon.
Ambato is a larger town than Riobamba,
and may contain 5000 people. In this place I
found myself comfortably lodged in the house of
the Governor. My luggage, along with the New
Testaments, did not arrive till the following morning.
Upon the arrival of the New Testaments, I
showed them to the Governor, and told him of my
intention of advertising them for sale, and inquired
in what shop or store I could conveniently do so.
He answered me, by saying, that his own house
was at my service for that purpose. I accordingly
stated in the advertisement, that the New Testaments
were on sale at the house of the Governor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
and that the sale would continue but one day. It
afforded me much satisfaction to see the interest
taken in this matter by the Governor and by his
lady, both of whom took great pleasure in showing
the New Testaments to those who came to buy,
and when I had to go out to pay or return a visit,
they kindly supplied my place until my return.</p>

<p>You cannot but have observed the liberality,
kindness, and encouragement I have met with from
the Governors of Guaranda, Riobamba and Ambato,
in the service of the Society. These circumstances
are very encouraging as to your future
labours and expectations in this quarter, and are
circumstances of which you will not fail to take advantage.
The three individuals mentioned, will
be most ready, I am persuaded, on any future occasion,
to forward in the most obliging and effectual
manner the holy object of your Society. They will
also readily lend their influence for the establishment
of Bible Societies in their respective districts,
as soon as a Society of a national character shall be
formed in the capital, to which they may become
auxiliaries. Of this Society in the capital, which I
have much in view and at heart, I shall inform
you afterwards, should it please the Lord to conduct
me safely to that place. That you may not,
however, lose the advantages already gained by
the acquisition of these gentlemen, as co-operators
in your work, I shall here give you their names and
addresses in the style of the country. “Sᵒʳ Coronel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Carlos Araujo, Gobernador de Guaranda; Sᵒʳ Ambrosio
Dávalos, Gobernador de Riobamba; Sᵒʳ
Nicolas Bácones, Gobernador de Ambato.” In the
preceding addresses, I have given you verbatim
what you should write in addressing any letter to
them. The best manner of communicating with
these gentlemen will be through Guayaquil, as that
is the nearest port, and with which there is constant
intercourse. During the time I remained in Guayaquil,
I stopped in the house of Messrs. Robinet
and Wheelwright, and found there every facility
afforded me in forwarding the work of the Society.
If you would communicate with that house in your
transactions with Guayaquil, Guaranda, Riobamba,
and Ambato, you will find, I am persuaded,
all attention paid to your concerns.</p>

<p>I mentioned above, that my advertisement stated
the sale to last for one day only. I was, however,
detained another day, and thus gave an additional
opportunity for purchasing. The whole number
sold amounted to forty-seven copies; but a small
number, indeed, yet great as a beginning, and as
an encouragement. I may mention, also, that the
rector and several clergymen bought copies, and
that I heard of no opposition.</p>

<p>In one of my letters from Guayaquil I told
you that the 200 Bibles you had ordered me
had not arrived in Lima when I left that place,
and to my no small regret. I have, however,
regretted that delay a thousand fold in the course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
of my journey. I mentioned to you at the same
time, that I had bought one Bible in Lima to
carry with me, by way of a specimen, and to excite
an interest to purchase when a supply should
arrive. All my expectations in regard to this
have been fully realized. The many offers I have
had to purchase this Bible, have filled me with
pleasure and with pain; pleasure to see so great a desire
for the word of God, and pain in not being able
to satisfy that desire. Of the many occasions in
which I have been so placed, none was so pleasing,
on the one hand, nor so painful, on the other, as
that which I experienced with the Rector of Ambato.
He had been to visit me, and I went to
his house to return his kindness. After experiencing
much attention from him, he in a very formal
manner urged me to sell him the Bible. I
stated to him, upon this occasion, what I had
been called on to state upon so many other occasions,
namely, that the Bible I had was a
kind of common property, that my object in carrying
it with me was to show it to all, and to encourage
all who wished for it, by informing them
that a number of copies were coming, and that
their desire would be realized in the possession
of this precious volume. He however renewed
his request, besought me to let him have it, and
urged his claim in the name of all his flock, for
whose use he said he particularly wished it. My
difficulty here was great, yet I considered my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
reasons for not parting with this volume still greater,
and was thus obliged most unwillingly to withhold
what, under other circumstances I would
most gladly have bestowed. He said, among
other things, to induce me to yield to his request,
that I would be able to find a copy in Quito, for
he had learned that some had been sold here some
time ago, as was actually the case, for 40 copies
of the 500 sold in Lima were brought here. I
told him that there were some doubts as to my
obtaining a copy in Quito, but that I would make
inquiry when I should arrive there, and in the
event of finding one I should send him my own
copy, and at the price at which I purchased the
other. Upon these terms we came to an agreement,
and he remarked that I should not make
any hesitation in regard to the price, for he
would willingly pay what should be charged.</p>

<p>On the 4th current I left Ambato on my way
to this city. There is a town called Tacunga or
Latacunga about 20 miles distant from Ambato,
and on the straight road to this place. From the
consideration of having been much detained in
my journey from Guayaquil, I wished to reach
this city as quickly as possible, and on that account
I intended not to stop at Tacunga, but to
push on to a village called Mulaló, and to pass
the night there, in order that I might reach Quito
on the following day. I was the more inclined
to do so, as I understood that Tacunga was inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
almost wholly by Indians, none of whom
could use our books. Another arrangement, however,
had been determined on by a higher authority
than mine, and for a purpose which you will presently
see. I had scarce left Ambato, when a
Friar travelling for Quito, came up with me upon
the road. As he was accompanied by a servant
only, and unencumbered with luggage, he could
get faster on his way than I could, accompanied
as I was by the loaded mules. We, notwithstanding,
rode together for some time, and fell
into various conversation. He urged me to go
forward with him, and to leave the loaded mules
to follow us, which, after some hesitation, I complied
with, and we went on together at a gentle
trot. His intention was to stop all night at Tacunga,
as he had some concerns to arrange there.
He kindly invited me to stay there also during the
night, in order that we might go on together
next day towards Quito, offering me a hospitable
lodging in the convent of St. Dominic, to which
he belonged. I still, however, thought it my duty
to push forward, so as to reach Quito next day,
and which I could not do if I stopped all night
at Tacunga. Before we arrived at the place, in
passing a river, my horse, upon reaching the bank,
which was rather difficult of access, stumbled,
plunged again into the river, and nearly threw
me into it. I got safely out, though considerably
wet. This circumstance determined me to stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
at Tacunga till I got my clothes dried. Upon
reaching the town, I went with my friend to the
convent, where I got myself comfortably dried,
and prepared for the journey. Before I was ready
to set out, there came on a thunder storm, and
by the time the weather cleared up, it was too
late to set out. My good friends in the convent
strongly urged me to pass the night with them, and
which I consented to do.</p>

<p>I found this town larger than I expected, and
as I was to pass the night in it, I was anxious to
seize the opportunity of offering the word of God
to them, although I had not much confidence as
to the success I should meet with. In carrying
this purpose into effect, I found myself rather
embarrassed. I was lodged in a convent, and
knew not what disposition the friars might have
to the distribution of the Scriptures, especially
to their being sold in the convent. I wished myself
lodged elsewhere, and indeed any where else,
but could not with any decency remove, as my
friends loaded me with kindness. Had I known,
upon my entering the town, that I was to have
a sale of the New Testaments there, I would not
have gone to the convent, more especially as I
had a letter of introduction to the Governor and
to another gentleman in the place. After some
hesitation, I resolved to make an attempt where
I was. I went pensively to the case in which
the New Testaments were, took out one, and went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
direct to the Prior to show it to him, praying
all the while as I went, that the God of heaven
would dispose his heart and the hearts of the
rest to befriend the circulation of his holy word.
My prayer was heard. The Prior was much
pleased with the New Testament, and bought it.
He showed it to one of the rest, and recommended
it, whilst I did not fail to put in a word to the
same effect, pointing out the advantages of the
Scriptures to all, and how more immediately it
concerned them, as ministers of religion, to possess
it, and to recommend it to others. Yes, said one
of them, it is the very book which concerns us,
and we would gladly encourage others to receive
it. I then told them that I had a number of copies,
and that I wished to expose them to sale in that
town. I showed the Prior the advertisement, and
said, I should be glad to have the sale in the convent,
if it were agreeable to him. By all means,
said he, and immediately he filled up the blanks
in the notices with his own hand, and sent a person
to fix them up. The advertisements were scarcely
up, when one, and another, and another came
tripping in to purchase a New Testament. In a
little, the buyers thickened, whilst all the friars
stood around enjoying the sight, and warmly recommending
the sacred volume to all who came,
and assisted me in the sale when occasion required.
The result was, that in two hours and
a half, that is, till the night came on, I sold <em>one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
and four</em> copies, which was more than I had
sold in Guaranda, Riobamba, and Ambato taken
together, although I remained two days in each
of these places. You see, by this time, I dare
say, why superior arrangements called me to stop
at this place, contrary to my own intention.</p>

<p>Among others, whom the sound of our horn
brought together, came the Vicar of the town
<i>in propria persona</i>. Upon learning who he was,
I made my obeisance, and entered into conversation
with him, as to the advantages of the word of
God, and the duty of making it known to all,
and to my great joy I found in him also a friend to
this object. At an early period of our sale, I
brought out the Bible, of which I have spoken
above, and for the purpose there mentioned. It had
the desired effect. It arrested the attention,
and could have been sold many a time. I told
all who wished to purchase it, that there would arrive
in a few months a number of copies, and that
all would be supplied. None being able to obtain
it, a little circle resolved to improve the occasion to
learn what it contained, while a friar in the middle
kept reading aloud for a considerable time.—There
was another attractive, namely, the Brief View
of the Bible Society. This also drew the attention,
and was eagerly read. Their approbation
of the object of the Society, and their wonder at
the effects already produced by it, alternately
drew forth corresponding expressions. You need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
not be told that I relished the scene before me,
and enjoyed a high entertainment. I could not
refrain from silent thanksgiving to the God above,
as I brought out another and another parcel of New
Testaments, to which I joined a fervent prayer, that
on this occasion the word of God might be sown
in good ground, and might produce in some thirty,
in some sixty, and in some a hundred fold. I
felt also my heart warm within me, whilst the
contemplation of the British character, which was
thus brought under review, called forth the just
praises of my native land. O favoured isle! garden
of God! where the fruits of righteousness grow
more abundantly than in all the world beside.
Peace be upon thee! In thee may the will of God
be done—<em>as it is done in heaven</em>.</p>

<p>By and by the night came on, and our sale
closed. After which we retired to one of the
cells and entered into general conversation. We
were all pleased with each other. My friends,
on the one hand, seized every opportunity to show
their kindness and attention, and I, on the other
hand, in return for their kindness, amused them
with my mountain barometer, thermometers, and
pocket compass, all of which were perfectly new to
them, and highly entertaining. At a proper hour
the friars retired to their cells, and I also retired
to mine, where I passed part of the night in contemplating
the scene which had just passed before
me, and the rest in repairing the fatigues of the
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>I told the Prior of the convent and the others,
that the sale which had been effected in that place,
so much greater than in the other places I had
visited in their neighbourhood, did great honour
to their town. I took occasion also to return them
my sincere thanks for the very active and friendly
part they had taken in this matter, and told them
I should have great pleasure in communicating the
same to the Society in London, and which I accordingly
now do. The Prior said that he should be
very glad, upon any future occasion, to forward the
objects of the Society as far as he could, and that
in regard to any other supply of the Scriptures
destined for Tacunga, he would most readily take
charge of them, and dispose of them according to
the directions which might be sent with them.
The other Friars heartily seconded the Prior in all
these matters. In conversing about the Bibles
that were to come to them from Guayaquil, it was
agreed that not fewer than fifty copies would be
required for Tacunga, and I promised to write to
Guayaquil in order that this number might be sent
to them upon their arrival there from Lima. At
the same time I write to Lima to forward a sufficient
supply to Guayaquil of your second edition,
which must, I should think, be already in Callao,
or near it.</p>

<p>In the preceding part of this letter, I gave you
the names and address of some persons who would
gladly carry forward your object in the places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
mentioned. I now add to this list another,
namely, the Prior already mentioned, “El R. P.
Fr. Manuel Peñaherrera, Prior de Santo Domingo
de Latacunga.” The person just named, as
well as all his colleagues, will be most ready to
establish an Auxiliary Bible Society in that place,
when the proper time comes for doing so. I give
you also the names of some others belonging to
this convent, as my duty and my promise require
of me, and could wish that in some corner of one of
your monthly extracts or annual reports their names
might be recorded, for I think they are worthy of
it; and in seeing their names in any of these publications
I shall feel myself as discharged from
what nearly amounts to an obligation, and which
my feelings of respect and gratitude towards my
friends led me into. The names are as follows:
Padre Mariano Quintana, Padre Narciso Molina,
Padre Matias Granja. To which I add, as the
last, but not the least, my travelling companion,
Padre José Celio.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>I conclude this letter, the writing of which
has been the means of my enjoying over again the
encouraging scenes which I have endeavoured to
describe, and which I lay before you that you may
comply with the pleasing duty of rejoicing with
those that rejoice.—I only add, May God Almighty
prosper you most abundantly in all your
undertakings; and unto whom in all things be
glory for ever: Amen.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> These names were not inserted in the Society’s Extracts,
as the Secretaries thought the doing so might, perhaps, compromise
our friends there with their superiors. A letter,
however, was written to the Prior, in the name of the Society,
conveying to him those sentiments which his conduct, on the
above occasion, called forth. A few weeks ago an answer
was received from the Prior, in reply to this letter, in which
he expresses his continued interest in the object of the Bible
Society, and his desire to circulate the Scriptures in his
native country.—It may be mentioned here also, that a suitable
letter was sent by the Society to the Governor of Guaranda,
and that a very friendly reply to it has been lately received.
This gentleman continues a warm friend to the
Bible Society.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Quito, 19th November, 1824.</i></p>

<p>A considerable time has elapsed since the
date of my last letter to you, and during the same
period, if I remember right, I have not been favoured
with any of your communications. So that,
as far as mere exchange of letters is concerned, I
am not so much in arrear as you may perhaps be
thinking. It is true, indeed, that it is my part to
write to you, rather than yours to write to me, but
that again supposes that I have something worth
communicating. Now, I am sorry to say that this
has not been the case during my partial silence, a silence
arising from a very natural cause, that of having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
nothing to say. I mean that I have had nothing to
say about the <em>progress</em> of education in this quarter:
and though I have still very little to say upon that
subject, yet, knowing you take a great interest in
the well being of this part of the world, and in my
feeble efforts to promote it, I think it my duty to
let you know at least where I am, and what I am
doing.</p>

<p>You will observe by the line at the top, that I
am in the city of Quito, and I shall now state to
you why I am here, and what I am engaged in.
You know how the war has raged for some time
past in Peru, and that Lima has been for a considerable
time in the hands of the enemy. I am
not sure that I have expressed myself correctly in
saying <em>the enemy</em>, a term applied by each party to
the other, but which in the mouth of a neutral is
an impropriety of speech. I beg leave to justify
myself in this, by informing you that I am not a
neutral in this contest, as all my feelings and my
wishes are on the one side, and of course the other
side is the enemy. I leave you to find out at your
leisure what side I am on, and shall proceed to give
you what information I have to communicate relative
to our concerns, the concerns of education.</p>

<p>I left Lima in the beginning of September, with
the intention of not returning to it for some time.
The immediate cause was the impossibility of
moving forwards in our work under the pressure of
existing circumstances. The very utmost that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
could be done was to keep hold of what we had
obtained, and even that was done with great difficulty.
Our model school in Lima, at the time I
came away, contained about 200 children, a number
somewhat less than what it contained some
months previous to that time. This decrease is
owing to the great poverty that existed there, on
the one hand; and on the other hand it arose from
a natural fear in the parents lest their children
should be picked up on their way to the School
by the recruiting parties, a fear not altogether
groundless. I may mention here, that there is
another School on our plan, containing about 80
children.</p>

<p>You know that, for a considerable time back, I
have had a desire to pass through that part of this
Continent where I now am, but I was prevented
from doing so, by the difficulty of leaving Lima in
the state in which things were, and by the prospect
of making a rapid progress in extending education
over Peru. At the time I came away, the difficulty
referred to was removed, and the prospect in
regard to the other circumstance mentioned was
altogether blasted, at least for a time. The difficulty
I have noticed was the want of a proper
master, in whose hands I could trust the school with
confidence. The school, however, at my leaving
Lima, was in the hands of a good master, with an
assistant to aid him, whilst the superintendence of
all is in the hands of my excellent friend the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Clergyman, of whom I have often spoken to you
with approbation. From this good friend, notwithstanding
these favourable arrangements, I was
obliged to tear myself away. He urged me to
stop, and would at length only hear of my going
away in the expectation of my early return, and in
the hope of my visit to England being turned to the
advantage of the schools in Peru, as I trust it will,
should I have the happiness to reach your favoured
country.</p>

<p>I thought it advisable, and my duty, to seize the
time that thus offered for verifying my long-intended
journey. You know, I dare say, that it
was not the mere desire of jaunting that led me to
propose this journey to myself. The two objects
which have hitherto more immediately engaged my
attention in South America are those which form
the work respectively of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, and the British and Foreign School
Society. With these two objects in view, I left
Lima for Bogotá the capital of Colombia. Though
I can never lose sight of any one of these two
objects, yet that of the Bible Society is the main
one in this journey.</p>

<p>I have been very much pleased with my journey,
in the prosperity I have had in the distribution of
the sacred volume. I have observed a very general
desire to possess this book, and I have had the
pleasure of seeing great numbers flock together,
not to receive it as a present, but to buy it. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
upwards of 1500 New Testaments which I had at
the outset, not many remain. I had no Bibles,
and was very sorry for it, as, from its being generally
asked for, I am sure I could have sold many copies.
It is gratifying to know that a supply of them may be
expected in the course of a few months; and with
this prospect I have revived the spirits of many
who evidently felt disappointed when I told them
that I had none.</p>

<p>It is truly a pleasing sight to see so many eagerly
seeking after God; and it cheers the heart of the
poor traveller, as he moves along now through the
woods, now over the mountains, to think that he is
the means of cheering the hearts of others, by
putting into their hands the only book which
can effectually cheer the heart with solid comfort.
I refer you for further particulars regarding
the circulation of the Scriptures to my letters
upon the subject to the British and Foreign Bible
Society.</p>

<p>Before I speak of the state and progress of education
in Quito, I shall mention two circumstances
which have occurred to me since I left Lima. I
notice these because they are encouraging, as it
respects the progress of education, and because they
tend to prove what I have so often stated to you,—that
there is a very general desire throughout this
country for extending the benefits of education to
all, and with all possible speed. The circumstances
referred to occurred in Truxillo and in Guayaquil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
In both these places I received proposals from the
magistrates to remain among them, in order to establish
schools on our plan, and to promote the
objects of education in general. In both cases I
had a struggle with my feelings, though not with
my judgment, in declining the honour offered me.
Though my duty bade me pursue my journey, yet,
in consequence of these proposals, I cannot help
taking an additional interest in the progress of education
in the places mentioned; and through the
intercourse that took place upon this subject during
my short stay in these tours, I expect some good
will result, of which I shall afterwards inform
you.</p>

<p>I come now to speak of the state and prospects of
education in this city. The state of elementary
education here is, at present, very low, but its
prospects are more encouraging. Perhaps you are
aware that the Colombian Government is taking
active measures to extend education over all their
share of South America. Some time ago a Central
School on the Lancasterian plan was established in
Bogotá, the capital. This school was set agoing
by a friar who had been banished from his native
country on account of his then-called revolutionary
principles, and who had learned the system during
his exile. Upon his return to America he established
this school in the capital, which has now existed
two or three years. It is the wish of the government
to put a model school in the capital of each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
department, and from these schools to send out
masters to all the towns and villages the department
contains. For this purpose the friar I before mentioned,
has lately arrived here, and is getting his
school-room prepared. I have had several conversations
with this individual, and have been
much pleased in observing the very lively interest
he takes in the education of youth, as well as in
the general progress of knowledge throughout his
native country. It is delightful to shake hands
with such persons, and to unite one’s heart with
them wherever they are found. I augur much good
from the establishment and direction of schools by
a person of this character. I do from my heart
wish him great success, and a success equal to the
desires of his own benevolent mind. The Intendant
or Governor of the department is an excellent
man, and very desirous of the progress of
knowledge throughout this quarter. He is urging
forward the school with all diligence; and to
supply the children with books, he has bought of
me 50 New Testaments.</p>

<p>The next thing I have to notice is of some interest,
and respects female education. You are
aware, that the education of this sex is very
limited in South America. It is so in Quito, as
might be expected. From the consideration that
this is a large place, and the chief city of a large
and populous district of country, I was very desirous
of doing something towards establishing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
female school or academy here. I spoke to the
Intendant and others upon the subject, and found
them all willing to do whatever was practicable in
carrying into effect such a desirable object. The
plan I proposed was, to send for a well-instructed
person or two from England, in order to establish
at once a school or academy of the best description;
and I promised to do, on my part, all I could
to procure such persons upon my arrival in England.
My proposition was very favourably received,
and a plan was immediately thought of for
carrying it into effect. The want of funds was the
only obstacle that occurred, and where to find them
was the object to which the attention of all was
directed. At length it was discovered that there
was a certain religious house in the city which had
good funds belonging to it. This house is not a
nunnery, though it is somewhat allied to it. It is
what is here called a Beateria; and if one were
called upon to give it a name corresponding to its
nature, it might be called a House of Idleness.
This name, at all events, would suit the character
given me of it by the Intendant. To get this
house and its funds was now the object of consideration,
and a petition to the general government of
Colombia was thought of for that purpose. You
know that respecting a matter of this kind, it is necessary
to interest the female sex themselves in it.
I accordingly spoke with some ladies upon the subject,
and found them very anxious to lend their influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
to obtain the object in question. I am
lodged and very kindly treated in the house of the
Marquis de San José, and I wished that the Marchioness
should take the lead in this affair, as a
matter of courtesy on my part, and principally because
she is the person of most influence in the
place. I stated to her the plan proposed, of establishing
a school or academy in the style of those
in England, and was happy to find that she entered
heartily into it. The way ultimately fixed upon
for carrying forward the plan is this: The lady
before mentioned, along with some female friends,
is to draw up a petition to the Intendant, begging
that something may be done for establishing a female
academy in Quito. As soon as this comes
into the Intendant’s hands, he will state his opinion
upon the subject, strongly recommending it,
and pointing out where the funds may be obtained
for the purpose. The petition thus prepared is to
be put into my hands, and I am to have the honour
of laying it before the Vice-President in Bogotá
upon my reaching that city; and such is the interest
taken by the Government in these matters, that I
have no doubt of its complete success.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Quito, 24th November, 1824.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to you was written from this place,
and dated the 8th current, the day after my arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
I then stated to you what had occurred to me from
Riobamba until my arrival in this city. I shall
now, therefore, proceed to give you an account of
the reception your cause has met with in Quito.</p>

<p>When I set out from Guaranda on my way to
Riobamba, I left four boxes of New Testaments
behind me, partly because I was going out of the
straight road for Quito, and partly because mules
could not readily be had to carry them. These
boxes I left in the hands of my good friend the
Governor, who kindly undertook to forward them
direct to this city. Upon my arrival here, I found
that these boxes had not arrived, although there was
more than sufficient time. I waited for them with
some impatience, especially as I had disposed of the
contents of those I had brought with me, so that there
remained none in my hands for sale in this place.
During this delay of the New Testaments I had
many inquiries for them, as it had got abroad that
I had brought with me a good supply for this city.
At length a part arrived, when I learned that the
delay was owing to the owner of the mules. I
gave notice publicly of the sale, as I had done in
other places, and in a short time all were sold,
amounting to 137 copies. After these were all
gone, the inquiries after them continued, and I had
to put off the inquirers, with telling them that there
were two more boxes expected every minute. Day
passed on after day without the arrival of these,
until I was beginning a second time to think them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
lost. Yesterday afternoon, however, they safely
arrived, and as soon as they were opened 80 copies
were paid for and carried off by a highly respected
clergyman. Fifty of these were for the use of the
schools here, and were purchased on account of the
government, agreeably to an order given to that
effect some days previous to their arrival. Twenty-five
of the eighty were purchased at the request of
the Provincial of the Convent of St. Francis, for
the express purpose of putting a copy into the
hands of each friar in the convent. I noticed in
my last the triumph of our cause in the convent of
St. Dominic, in Latacunga, and it affords me no
small pleasure to be able to record what I may
call a triumph of a similar kind, as just mentioned,
regarding the Franciscans in this city. To which I
may add, that the respected clergyman I before
referred to, has orders from, I believe, all the convents
to purchase one, two, or more <em>Bibles</em> for them
at the moment of their arrival. The remaining
five of the above mentioned eighty were for particular
friends.</p>

<p>I have noticed to you, in my preceding letters,
the desire manifested in the places I have passed
through, for <em>the whole Bible</em>. This desire has also
been manifested in Quito, and in a strong degree.
In order to increase this desire, rather than supply
the wants of these places, I have written to Guayaquil,
directing the fifty Bibles which I formerly
ordered from Lima to that place, to be sent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
these parts, in due proportions; only ten or twelve
of these will come to this place, and these are
already bespoken. I have also ordered to be sent
to the different towns mentioned in my former
letters, a considerable number of copies of the
small New Testament, and of the Books of Psalms,
Proverbs, &amp;c.; the proportion for Quito is 200 of
the former, and 200 of the latter; these I expect
will meet with a very favourable reception, and
will fall short of the demand for them. I have
thus, you see, distributed the whole of the supply
sent me as mentioned in your last letter, yet this
supply, so distributed, will prove inadequate to the
wants and the demands of these quarters. To meet
this demand, we must have recourse to your <em>second</em>
edition of the Bible, of which you have advised
me, and of which I expect a good supply is already
on the way to Lima. In that city, and also in
Guayaquil, I have given the necessary directions
for sending proper quantities to each place. The
city of Quito is large, and contains upwards of
50,000 inhabitants. It is also surrounded by a
populous country, of which it is the capital and the
centre. On this account I have ordered to it
500 copies of the whole Bible, with a request to
our correspondent in Guayaquil to remit 500 more,
if the wants of the latter place will admit of it. I
have mentioned to you the names of different persons
who offered to manage your concerns in some of
the places I have passed through, and I am happy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
having it in my power to say, that you have found
a warm friend and an agent here in the Marquis of
San José, a gentleman of the first respectability
in this city, on account of his personal character,
and on account of his large possessions in this
quarter. From this gentleman I have received
every friendly attention during my stay under his
hospitable roof. He allowed me to sell the New
Testaments in his own house, and encouraged his
friends to purchase them. In consequence of his
readiness to take the charge of the Society’s concerns
here, I have ordered the supplies for Quito,
already mentioned, to be forwarded directly to
him. You will also please consider him as your
correspondent for this quarter, and can address to
him accordingly. His address is “Sᵒʳ Manuel de
Larrea, Marques de San José, Quito.” I spoke to
this gentleman, also, regarding the formation of a
Bible Society for the district of Quito, whose seat
should be in that city. Into this matter he entered
fully and cheerfully, and promised to do every
thing in his power to commence and to carry forward
such an establishment, as soon as a suitable
opportunity should offer for doing so. I spoke also
to the Marchioness regarding a Female Bible
Society, and had the pleasure of being assured by
her, that nothing should be wanting on her part to
set such a Society on foot. I have thus endeavoured
to place things in such a state as to induce the
hope that the concerns of the Bible Society will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
not be neglected here, but carried forward in a
prosperous manner. I should have mentioned
also, that several gentlemen, with whom I conversed
about the circulation of the Scriptures,
and about a Bible Society, much approved of both,
and expressed their readiness to lend their aid
in these matters, I trust these favourable circumstances,
which form an encouraging commencement
in this interesting and populous district, will
be followed by results truly beneficial to all the
inhabitants here, and gratifying to the members
of the British and Foreign Bible Society.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance indirectly, or rather I
should say directly, connected with our main object,
which I should not omit to state to you. I
carried with me two copies of the late Bishop of
London’s Evidences of Christianity, in Spanish.
These I bought in Lima about the time I set off,
in the expectation of their doing some good in the
course of the journey. I showed this work to
the Marquis, who immediately bought it. This
he eagerly read, and was highly gratified with
its contents. I could have sold the other copy
frequently, but refused to sell it, as I intend to
carry it farther on, and to dispose of it in some
other place. The Marquis lent his copy to several
of his friends, who were also much gratified with
perusing it. From less to more, the interest in
this work was carried, till it was resolved to print
an edition of it in Quito by subscription, and this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
subscription is to be solely among the ladies. This,
you see, is a feeling very friendly to the cause of
religion, and of the Bible Society. I suppose I
need not to tell you, that a work on the evidences
of the christian religion is not a little wanted in
many parts in this country, as there are many who
are verging towards, or are already gone into, deism.
On this account, as well as on others, it behoves
the friends of Christianity to bestir themselves in
behalf of South America. The present is a
very interesting and also a very critical period for
this country. Much, very much, may be done
at present, through prudent and zealous means,
to instruct and confirm the wavering, and even
perhaps to bring back those who have apostatized
from the faith. If these measures were connected
with means of instruction, as far as can be
done, regarding the true principles and practices of
Christianity, as taught in the Holy Scriptures, a
very plentiful harvest, through the blessing of God,
might be reaped. If it should please the Lord to
spare me, and to enable me to reach my native
land, I trust I shall find many ready to lend their
aid towards such a sacred object.</p>

<p>P.S.—<i>26th November, 1824.</i>—I have now
disposed of 360 copies of the New Testament
in this city. May the Lord follow with his
abundant blessing this seed which has been sown,
and cause it to bring forth a hundred fold.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
To-day I set off for Popayan, and trust that
<em>He</em> who has preserved me thus far, will continue
to me his blessing to that place, and thence
onwards. I shall endeavour to drop a few seeds
as I go along, and pray that these may fall into
good ground.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Popayan, 1st January, 1825.</i></p>

<p>You will perceive, by the date of this letter,
that it is a month later than it ought to be, according
to our epistolary agreement. You will
not wonder at this delay, when you consider that
I am in the middle of a long and incommodious
journey. The day on which I should have written
you, I was travelling from Otabalo to Ibarra,
and of course had neither leisure nor convenience
for conversing with you. I now seize the opportunity
of a few days rest which I enjoy in this
city, to write you a few lines.</p>

<p>You will probably he expecting some account
of the country in which I now am, and through
which I have lately passed. I shall endeavour
to satisfy your curiosity in some measure upon
this point. I shall begin with Guayaquil. That
place contains from 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants,
and is situated upon a river of the same name.
There are regular tides in the river opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
town, twice in the 24 hours, and the same also
takes place for a considerable distance above the
town. The spot on which the town is built is
very low, being only a very little higher than the
river at the time of high water. The weather here
is very hot, considerably more so than in Lima.
This, together with a low and somewhat marshy
situation, makes the place unhealthy, particularly
in the rainy season. I could not help observing,
however, during the short time I was there, that
the want of cleanliness in the streets, and on
the banks of the river, are circumstances which
contribute, in my opinion, at least one half to the
unhealthiness of the town. This port is the place
on the Pacific which at present affords more
articles of exportation than any other, and every
succeeding year will make it more so. The cocoa
from which the chocolate is made is the principal
article, and of this several ship-loads go annually
to Europe, besides what is used in Peru, Chile,
&amp;c. It is through this place that all the towns,
as far as Quito, are supplied with European goods,
and through this place also should these towns
be supplied with the Holy Scriptures, and with
other works which may contribute to enlighten
and to benefit them with respect to time and to
eternity. I have made arrangements there by
which the Scriptures may be supplied to these
quarters in future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>The town of Guaranda is high up on the Andes,
and within a few miles of the great Chimborazo.
It enjoys a temperate and healthy climate, notwithstanding
its proximity to the Equator. I need not
state to you the causes of this, as you are well aware
of them. I may, however, say that Chimborazo
exerts a considerable influence in moderating the
heat which might be expected in this quarter.
If you should ask me more particularly what I
think of the climate, I would say, judging from my
own feelings, that it is cold. So I felt it to be, but
that arose partly from my having just come from
a very hot climate. It is curious to observe the
different feelings of two persons met together on
the declivity of the mountains, the one ascending
from Guayaquil, and the other descending from
Quito. If you ask one of them regarding the
climate, or weather, he says it is very cold; and if
you ask the other, he says it is very warm; and so
they respectively feel from the opposite climates
they have come from. Guaranda is situated on the
western side of the western Cordillera of the
Andes. You will observe that the word <i>Andes</i>, is
the general name of all these mountains, and
<i>Cordillera</i> means the high ridge or line of mountains
running nearly north and south. There are
two great cordilleras which extend from Cuenca to
about 100 miles to the north of Popayan. To the
south of Cuenca and to the north of the department<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
of Popayan, one of the Cordilleras disappears. In
going from Guaranda to Riobamba, you first
ascend the western cordillera to the top. On this
<em>top</em> is the <em>base</em> of Chimborazo. The road is close
along the base of the mountain and you would
think you could lay your hand upon it. From
<em>this spot</em> it does not appear a very high mountain,
and the reason is obvious, as this spot itself is at a
great elevation.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The whole of Chimborazo, except
perhaps, a few yards, is covered with snow—everlastingly
covered. Having reached this top,
you see, for the first time, the eastern cordillera,
vying with the western in height. You then descend
down till you come to Riobamba, which is situated
in a <em>level</em> plain between the two ridges, and at
nearly an equal distance from both. The whole of
my journey, from leaving Riobamba till my arrival
in this city, has been in this great valley, between
the two cordilleras of the Andes. In two days
or three after leaving this place, I will have to
cross the eastern cordillera on my way to Bogotá.</p>

<p>The two principal towns between Riobamba and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Quito, are Ambato and Tacunga, and of which I
have spoken in my letters to Mr. B.; the former
may contain 5,000, and the latter 6,000. The
greater part of this population consists of Indians,
who all speak the ancient Peruvian language.
The largest town in the whole of this extensive
valley, between the ridges of the Andes, is Quito.
It is a city of 50,000 inhabitants and upwards, and
will not yield to any city in South America in
point of population, except to Lima and to Buenos
Aires. Its public buildings are much superior to
those of the latter place, and not much inferior to
those of the former. Its site is unfavourable, as it
is placed on an uneven piece of ground.</p>

<p>In travelling from Quito to Popayan you experience
a great variety of climate. Sometimes
you have the unmitigated heat of the torrid zone; at
another time you might imagine yourself in the
neighbourhood of one of the poles rather than the
equator; and again at other times you have a climate
of the most delightful kind, equally removed
from the extremes of heat and of cold. One of the
coldest nights I passed on the journey, was within
a few yards of the line. You will wonder,
perhaps, at this variety, but I will explain it to
you. Here and there, during the whole course of
this long valley, from Cuenca to Popayan, you
have, rising out of the one cordillera or the other,
an enormous snow-capped mountain. It is evident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
that the cold reigns uninterrupted on these towering
summits, as the snow, its certain signal, is ever
spread over them. Of course when the wind blows
from these, it temperates (or perhaps somewhat
more) the heat of the sun wherever it passes.
Any place situated near these mountains is necessarily
temperate, or cold. The coldest place in the
whole road, is a place called Tiupuyo, some 20
miles south of Quito, because there you have
Cotopaxi on the one side, and right opposite on
the other you have Ilinisa, both of which are
always covered with snow. I have thus noticed to
you the cause of the cold, and shall now point out
what is the cause of the heat in those places where
its effects are most felt. Wherever there is a deep
valley with sloping mountains around, and no
towering summits covered with snow, for a considerable
distance, there you have a climate of the
same kind as is met with in the same latitude on
the sea coast. As to the temperate places I have
spoken of, they are always to be met with in the
absence of these snow-covered mountains on the
one hand and the deep valleys on the other. In
these tracts the climate is delightful in the extreme,
all the year round. In none of these parts have
you Spring, Summer, Harvest, and Winter, but
one uniform temperature from one end of the year
to the other. In most of these places there are
periodical times of rain, which form what they call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the Winter, whilst the dry season is called Summer.
The farmer there may sow when he chooses, and
may have his harvest in any month of the year;
notwithstanding, however, there is some order attended
to in this respect, but it is not uniform in all
places.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The top of this ridge, or cordillera, cannot be less than
17,000 feet above the level of the sea. On arriving at this
height, I recollected what I had often read of, that persons
at great elevations felt much difficulty in breathing. I resolved
to try the correctness of these accounts: and for this
purpose, I alighted from my horse, and with a heavy great-coat
on, I walked with a quick pace for half an hour. The
result was, I felt not the slightest inconvenience in breathing.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Bogotá, 8th February, 1825.</i></p>

<p>Since my last communication to you from Quito,
I have had a long, and by no means an agreeable
journey. The distance from Quito to this place
is considerable, the roads are very bad, and in
passing through one district, there is no inconsiderable
danger. On the 29th ultimo, I arrived
safely in this city, and now seize the first opportunity
that offers of writing you a few lines, to
inform you of occurrences in these parts since my
last, of the 26th November.</p>

<p>I intimated to you in the letter last mentioned,
that it was my intention to drop a few seeds as
I went along, or in other words, to endeavour
to circulate the sacred volume, as opportunities
might offer, in the course of my journey. I accordingly
posted up my notices in those places,
where I stopped for half a day, or upwards. In
these country villages a great sale was not to be
expected. The inhabitants are in general poor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
and very few of them are addicted to reading.
Some copies, however, were thus put into circulation,
and in such places, and under such circumstances,
I always think much has been done if a
kind of beginning has been made. I shall, in a future
communication, state to you the number sold in
each place, and the respective sums received since
my leaving Lima. I would give you this account
now, were it not that the scantiness of my time
at present will not allow me to extract these notices
from among my notes. I have now disposed of
<em>all</em> the New Testaments I brought with me from
Lima, and those which I found awaiting me in
Guayaquil. I bless the Lord for having counselled
me to undertake this journey, and thus to
put into circulation a considerable number of copies
of his holy word, and which would not likely
have been accomplished, but by means of making
a complete tour through these quarters. I have
thus cause of gratitude to Him who distributeth
his favours to whom he will, for having honoured
me with a share of this angel-work, of communicating
the revelation of God to man. I shall
be glad also to know, that the plan I have taken
meets with the approbation of the Committee of
the British and Foreign Bible Society. I thought
much about this journey before undertaking it,
and prayed much to the Lord to counsel me in
regard to it. And now, looking back over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
road I have travelled, and reflecting on the number
of copies of the word of life, now in the hands
of many people who had never before seen it, I
feel my heart drawn out in thanksgiving and praise
for all the way by which the Lord hath led me.</p>

<p>My labours in distributing the sacred volume
on this journey must now terminate, because I
have no more to distribute. In the multitude of
my thoughts within me upon setting off from Lima,
it occurred to me that I might, after reaching this
place, extend my journey in your service to Guatemala,
and from thence overland to Mexico.
Two objects I had in view in reference to this;
the one was the circulation of the Scriptures, and
the other was the procuring translations of the
New Testament into the native languages of those
parts. Of this latter object I wrote you some
time ago. This intended journey, however, must
now be given up, for various reasons. The first
is, because I have no more copies of the Scriptures
to distribute; the second is, because I feel
doubtful if it would meet with your approbation
to incur the expense of travelling through those
parts, with the single object of procuring the
translations referred to; the third reason is, the
happy change which has taken place in Peru,
in the termination of the war there, and which
induces me to visit England as early as possible,
that I may again return to Lima without loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
of time, in order to carry on the work of the Lord
there, according to the grace and strength he may
be pleased to afford me. I trust in the Lord that
we shall have an opportunity of seeing each other
face to face, before many months elapse, that
we may talk over all the doings of the Lord, in
making his word to circulate in this country and
in every place, and that we may make arrangements
for benefiting South America yet more extensively.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the <em>termination</em> of the war
in Peru, and this to me is no small subject of
thanksgiving; for the deliverance of the country
from the Spanish yoke, and the rapid progress
of the Lord’s work, are closely identified. I wrote
you from Guayaquil some months ago respecting
this identification. It was then I gave you an
account of the battle of Junin, and of the very
important effects that followed. I then also ventured
to speak of what were likely to be the ultimate
and no very distant results of that battle.
All these things the Lord hath now brought about,
in scattering those who delight in war and oppression,
and in commanding the destroying sword
to return into its scabbard.—Rest and peace to
this destroying instrument—and for ever! May
it never more be drawn in this country, to cut
in sunder afresh the peace and the progress of
man! I send you an account of this late event
in Peru, which I think will prove interesting to
you and to your friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>I expected to find, on my arrival here, a large
supply of Spanish New Testaments, which I
thought you would have found an opportunity
of forwarding to some correspondent in this quarter.
I have spoken with Mr. Henderson, the
British Consul General here, upon the subject,
and he informs me that there are neither Spanish
Bibles nor New Testaments in this city, and that
there is a demand for them. He also informs me,
that he wrote about three months ago to Mr. Dowson,
a correspondent of his, requesting him to forward
some to this place. You will please make inquiry
of Mr. D., who lives in Welbeck Street, if he has
sent any; and in the event of none having been
sent, have the goodness to forward to this city, as
early as possible, a supply of each of your editions
of the Spanish Scriptures. I have talked with
Mr. Henderson upon this subject, and think he
will be a very suitable person to manage your
concerns here, and to correspond with you. He
takes a particular interest in this matter, and desires
me to assure you of his readiness to do all that
lies in his power to forward your good work.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Bogotá, 25th February, 1825.</i></p>

<p>I have noticed to you, more than once, the very
favourable reception given to the Scriptures in
these parts. I am now to state to you an exception,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
and it is in a quarter where it should not have
been found. The only person whom I found unfriendly
to the circulation of the Scriptures without
notes, in the whole of the journey from Lima to
Bogotá, was the Bishop of Popayan. I have
stated his opposition in gentle terms, for truth requires
it. I heard, soon after putting up the advertisements
for the sale of the New Testaments,
that the Bishop had spoken against the reading of
them. I called upon him to know whether it was
so or not, and to learn what were his objections. I
had visited him before, and had had a visit from him
in return, so that we were, on this second visit, on
terms of a friendly intercourse, and we therefore
entered freely into the subject of the sale and distribution
of the Scriptures. I mentioned to him
what I had heard, and inquired whether I had
been correctly informed. He then told me the
whole of what had occurred upon the subject.
He said, a person who had bought one of the New
Testaments, brought it to him and asked his opinion
as to his using it. The person was a priest, and he
named him to me. The Bishop, upon his opinion
being asked, rose and brought the Acts of the
Council of Trent, and pointed out to the priest the
article there, prohibiting the use of the Scriptures
without notes. He concluded, however, by telling
the priest that <em>he</em> might keep his New Testament
and use it. This, said the Bishop, is all that occurred
upon this matter. He said farther, that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
was not his intention to oppose the circulation of
the New Testaments in any other way. If any
person chose to buy them, he would not interfere;
but if any one should ask his opinion upon the matter,
he would refer him to the same article, as his
duty required him to do. I said that I understood
the article in question was as he had stated it, but
that when I considered how many among all ranks
of the catholic clergy made no account of that
article, but freely encouraged the circulation of the
Scriptures among their flocks, I was inclined to
think that the article was qualified by something
subsequent to it, or that it was not generally considered
as in force. He replied to this, that there
was nothing subsequent to alter the force of that
article, but rather to strengthen it, and that whatever
others did, he considered his duty to be, to
follow the rules of the church in that and in all such
matters, as every good Catholic ought to do. I
said that I saw the force of what he said, considering
what were the principles of his faith. I added,
that notwithstanding his reasons, I could not but
be sorry to see any opposition to the circulation of
the Holy Scriptures, a book which God had graciously
given to all, and which should, of course, be
studied by all. I observed, also, that I was fully
persuaded that very great advantages would arise
from a general reading of the word of God, and
from these considerations I conceived it to be my
duty to put them into the hands of all, and to call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
upon all to read them with serious attention.
“Amen,” replied the Bishop, “I also am of the
same opinion. I am sure that it would be advantageous
to all to read the Scriptures, but then let
them be read with the necessary directions. If
Bibles and New Testaments were to come here
with the notes, I would be the first to promote their
circulation.” Our conversation was extended a
good deal further upon this subject, and embraced
the usual topics of this question, but which it is
unnecessary here to repeat.</p>

<p>I am labouring what I can to establish a Bible
Society here, and it is that alone which keeps me
longer in this city. I am not yet sure whether I
shall succeed or not, but my next letter will inform
you.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Bogotá, 1st March, 1825.</i></p>

<p>My last letter to you was written from Popayan
on the 1st of January. I informed you at
that time of some of the circumstances that occurred
to me in the way, and gave you some account
of the peculiar situation of the country from
Guayaquil to Quito. I shall now resume this description,
which I was obliged to break off abruptly
in my last. I remained about three weeks in
Quito, experiencing the kindest attentions from
many friends. The remembrance of my short stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
in that place will always be agreeable. Thanks be
to God for providing me friends in every quarter, and
may they all be fully rewarded for all their kindness.
I had several very interesting conversations
with the Rector, and with some of the Professors of
the College in that city, upon religious subjects;
and one of the Professors who understands English
begged me to let him have, at any price, two works
I carried with me. These were Jones’s Biblical
Cyclopedia and Stewart’s Philosophy of the Human
Mind. He said that if I could not spare both
works, he particularly wished for the first, as being
in the line of his profession as a clergyman, and
because he wished to examine the subject of
religion, not merely from their own writers, but
from ours also. I let him have both of them, with
which he was much gratified. These gentlemen
belonging to the College, whom I have just referred
to, manifested an excellent and liberal spirit
in regard to the improvements necessary in their
mode of education in the seminary to which they
belong. There are about 300 students in this
college.</p>

<p>Nothing very material occurred in the journey
from Quito until arriving at the province of Pastos.
This province has been for a long time past in a
very unsettled state. It has repeatedly raised the
standard of rebellion against the existing Government,
and has as often been reduced to subjection
by the force of arms. At each time it has suffered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
severely, and at present it resembles a deserted
country; the finest fields and pastures are met with,
without a single head of cattle. This province is
still but ill at rest, and may be said to be subdued
and reduced, rather than tranquillized. A proof of
that is to be found in the banditti which exist in it.
At the time we passed, there were three or four of
these parties in different places, and one of them
consisted of one hundred men. On arriving at
Tulcan, which is about three days journey from the
city of Pasto, the capital of the province, we had to
take with us a guard of ten men. We passed from
Tulcan to Pasto, without meeting with any enemy.
But from what we heard afterwards, we may consider
ourselves as having made a providential escape,
as there was a party of 16 men seen in these
quarters, a few days after we passed. In the city
of Pasto, there is constantly kept a body of about
a thousand men; some of these are employed in
searching out and in persecuting these banditti;
and some of them are employed in escorting the
mail and travellers from that to the province of
Popayan. The Governor of Pasto gave us an
escort of forty men, and which was judged necessary
from the general state of the province, and from
a recent occurrence. This occurrence was the
assault and murder of a merchant travelling from
Popayan to Pasto, notwithstanding his having an
escort of twelve men with him. The soldiers we
brought with us behaved very well; we kept a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
good look out, and mounted our centinels every
night, particularly in that spot where the murder
was committed, and where we passed the night.
Had we fallen in with any of these parties we
would have been hardly put to it, and had we
been worsted, we should certainly not have escaped
with life. From this, however, and from every
other danger on the journey, the Lord delivered
us. For all these mercies, I feel my heart stirred
up with gratitude and thanksgiving, and I feel a
desire more than ever to devote my whole life to
the service of God, and to the service of mankind.</p>

<p>I have already stated to you the unquiet state of
the Province of Pastos, and its desolateness in
consequence. The City of Pasto, the capital,
affords also a melancholy proof of this desolation.
Its population has been reduced from 15,000, to,
perhaps, not more than 4000, and in every street
you meet with numbers of houses waste and uninhabited,
with all the wood of the doors and windows
torn out, and which was used by the military
for firewood. You are not to consider this revolutionary
spirit as extending throughout the country,
but as confined exclusively to that province.</p>

<p>Upon my arriving at Popayan, I found there an
English medical gentleman, of the name of Wallis,
who has been upwards of twenty years in the
country. Dr. Wallis shewed me much kindness;
he was very friendly to the circulation of the Scriptures,
and aided me therein as much as he could.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
The number sold there was very small, considering
the size of the place, on account of some little opposition
from the Bishop, of which I have spoken
in one of my letters to Mr. B. The topography
of Popayan is worth noticing. It is situated
in a very large plain, called the valley of Cauca.
It is by far the largest plain in those quarters, the
Cordilleras separating farther from each other there
than in any other part, and the space between them
is, in general, even, or nearly so. It is watered by
a beautiful river, called Cauca. The population in
the whole valley is exceedingly small, considering
its size and fertility. There is little doubt, I think,
but it will one day become a place of great population
and importance. Its climate is healthy and
delightful, with an everlasting summer, and its productions,
taking one part with another include
every thing, from wheat to the sugar-cane. There
is no part of Colombia which I have yet seen, nor,
perhaps, of America, in which I could wish to live
in preference to Popayan.</p>

<p>No part of South America, I believe, has felt
more severely the effects of the revolutionary war
than the city of Popayan and its neighbourhood.
The city was taken and retaken, I believe, fourteen
times, and there is scarcely an individual in it who
has not a long tale of woes to relate, either of
himself or of his friends. It has now enjoyed peace
for some time, and is beginning to regain its former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
state, but years of tranquillity are necessary to
restore it fully. There is a mint here, which coins
annually about one million of dollars, of the gold
of Chocó, and from the mines of the province of
Popayan. There is also coined there twenty
thousand dollars of silver. The Director of the
Mint is a gentleman of the name of Pombo, a
literary man, and who has published two or three
elementary works for schools, of considerable
value.</p>

<p>From Popayan to Bogotá there are two roads
across the cordillera, but the one to the south is
the best. This is called the Pass of Guanacos,
and lies nearly east of Popayan; the other is called
Quindiu, and lies to the north. The cold on the
top of the mountain is generally pretty keen. The
ascent from Popayan is gradual, but the descent
on the other side is rapid, and you pass quickly
from a very cold climate to a hot one. It is a
frightful road in some places. You have frequently
to ascend and descend very steep places on this
side of the mountain, from the many deep glens
made by the rivers which you pass. You may be
said to be riding up stairs and down stairs in these
places, and in several of them it is literally so.
The mules are wonderfully steady, being accustomed
to these roads, so that they very seldom slip. Some
years ago an Italian doctor, passing that way, was
so frightened with the going down these stairs, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
he mounted his mule the reverse way, with his face
backwards, and then leaned him down flat upon
the mule. This attitude, together with his three-cocked
hat and queue, afforded no little diversion
to the muleteers who conducted him. This
kind of road continues till you come to the town of
La Plata, and after that you have a much better
road, the greater part of which is in the great valley
of the river Magdalena, and one of its contributaries.
The usual stages or places where you
hire mules, on the way between Popayan and
Bogotá are, La Plata, Neiva, and La Mesa. In
most places the mules are scarce, on account of the
great number of these animals destroyed by the
war. At proper distances on the road there are
houses called Tambos, which are the inns of the
place. These houses consist of a roof erected
upon poles, and without any walls, so that they
afford shelter from the rain, but not from the wind
and the cold. The town of La Plata is pleasantly
situated on the banks of a river of the same name,
on the first lowlands after getting out from the
great mountains. There is a great deal of fertile
land about the place, affording a great variety of
productions, including the sugar-cane, but these
fertile lands are almost all lying waste. The river
La Plata, about ten miles below the town, joins
the river Paez, a river on the banks of which we
travelled a good deal, and across which we passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
repeatedly. The La Plata and the Paez are
nearly of the same size, and make a fine stream
when united. When these two streams unite, the
whole goes by the name of Paez. After travelling
two days on the banks of the Paez, we saw it
fall into the Magdalena, and lose its name there.—From
the town of La Plata the heat begins, and
when you reach the Magdalena it is very great,
and continues so all along the banks of the river.
This is decidedly the hottest place I ever was in.
The thermometer every day rose to 97½, and remained
there two or three hours together. I was
in a constant state of perspiration during the 24
hours, except, perhaps, from 2 o’clock in the morning
till 8. This was the only respite, if respite it
might be called. At Neiva we left the road and
the mules, and took to the river, down which we
went for some days. From Neiva to Honda the
river is navigable in what are called balsas. The balsa
consists of long poles or trunks of trees laid close to
each other, with others laid over then cross-wise, and
again, above this row, or above an additional one,
is a kind of flooring, made of the bamboo flattened
out. The wood of which these balsas are made is
exceedingly light, and very well adapted for the use.
In this vessel there is not a single nail used, nor
a single rope. The poles are tied together with
what are called bejucos, which is a species of
plant that grows abundantly in these quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
and resembles a rope in length and thickness.
With these, which are of all sizes, the whole work
of nails and ropes is performed. Over the balsa
is raised a roof, thatched with what the wood
affords. This protects the luggage as well as the
passengers from the rain. In this rude vessel
we passed some days and some nights, sailing
when we had light, and at night fastened by one
of these ropes to a tree. The river was very shallow
at the time we passed, so that we frequently
got aground in the middle of the stream, at which
time our boatmen, or bogas as they are called,
had to get into the water and push us along. There
was another evil of a worse kind which we had
to encounter, namely, the trunks of trees sunk
deep in the bottom of the river, sometimes appearing
above the water, and sometimes not. It requires
a good deal of dexterity to steer among these
at times, as the current perhaps draws you straight
to them. Against one of these sunken trees we
drove one day, and fortunately broke it with the
blow. The shock pitched our bogas into the
river in a moment, but they were immediately
again on board. This blow, however, broke
some of our wooden ropes, and we were under the
necessity of fastening ourselves to a tree till we
got repaired. The bogas got into the wood, and
got, quite at hand, other ropes of a similar kind,
cut them down, repaired the bark, and in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
hour’s time we were again at sea. The general
landing place for travellers for Bogotá, is not as
far down as Honda, but at a place called Fusagasugá.
Here you leave the river, and begin
to ascend the hills, and afterwards the mountains,
and sensibly to change your climate from extreme
heat to temperature, but a temperature which,
under these circumstances, feels quite cold. On the
last day’s travel to this place, we began early in the
morning to ascend the mountain by a steep and
rugged road, closely wooded on both sides. We
kept ascending till about noon, when we reached
the top, and the wood disappeared. Here I expected
we would have had, as usual, to descend
again, but quite otherwise. On the top of this
mountain is a large beautiful plain, and at the
farther end of it stands the city of Bogotá.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="right"><i>Bogotá, 5th April, 1825.</i></p>

<p>I had the pleasure of writing you on the 25th
of February last, and of giving you an account of
those places, in which the Holy Scriptures were
distributed in the course of my journey. I noticed
to you at the same time, the only instance
I met with of opposition to the circulation of
the Scriptures without notes. I also informed
you of my endeavours to bring about the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
of a Bible Society in this city. By the last
packet for England, I sent you a copy of No. 29
of “The Constitutional,” a newspaper published
in this place, and which contained an advertisement
relative to the subject in question. By that advertisement,
you would see that something was
doing in the matter, and from the respectability
of the gentlemen who are there mentioned, you
would perceive that we had met with some valuable
supporters, and that there was a prospect
held forth of succeeding in this object. I now
send you Nos. 30, 31, and 32, of the same paper,
which will point out to you the different steps
we have taken, and you will be able to notice
also the progressive encouragement we obtained.
You will perceive by the two last numbers that
our Society at length obtained a fair and firm establishment.
I say a <em>fair</em> establishment, because
the whole of our transactions were done in open
day, and because all who wished to state their
objections were not only permitted, but encouraged
to do so. Our meeting on the 24th was
very well attended, and consisted of the most
respectable class of the community in this city, both
clergy and laity. We had, on that occasion, a
very warm and interesting discussion of the point
in question. A professor in one of the colleges
was the first who spoke, a man of very respectable
talents, and commendable for his Christian virtues,
but withal full of Catholic prejudices. This gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
opposed our object, as being contrary to the
acts of the general councils of the church, and as
being injudicious and hurtful, especially under present
circumstances. The next who spoke was the
very respectable rector of the principal college
of this city. In this gentleman we met with a
warm friend to our Institution, and we had the
pleasure of hearing him reply to the objections
of the preceding speaker. Both these individuals
are clergymen. The next who spoke was also a
clergyman, a well known and eloquent preacher
in this place, a man full of zeal, and who adorns
his profession by a very exemplary conduct. This
gentleman opposed our plans, as the first speaker
had done, and even went farther, and said, that
under existing circumstances, he considered it
improper to have a general circulation of the
Scriptures, even with the notes affixed. This last
observation relieved us a little, in respect to the
opposition we met with from this individual, as
it was plain that, as a Catholic, he proved too
much, and thus overshot his mark, and injured
his cause, inasmuch as he carried things farther
than either the Pope or the Council of Trent. This
ended our opposition, or at least finished the list
of our opponents, for no other individual present
spoke on that side of the question. The gentleman,
however, who had spoken first, was so full upon
his subject, that he rose again and again to advocate
his cause, until it was necessary to reply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
to him from the chair as to order, and to the giving
an opportunity to others to speak as well as himself.
Several gentlemen spoke in succession, and
warmly advocated the cause of the Bible Society
in general, and pointed out to the meeting the
consistency of the object of the Society to be established,
with the laws and customs of the people
of Colombia, and stating at the same time
the great advantages that would certainly arise
to their country, from a general circulation and
reading of the word of God, not encumbered with
notes, but in its own native simplicity, as it was
delivered by the Almighty to mankind. The two
Ministers of Government who were present, Mr.
Gual, and Mr. Castillo, very ably, and at considerable
length, defended and supported the
object of the Society, and pointed out that there
was nothing of a clandestine nature in the establishment
of this Institution, but that it had the full
and open approbation of the Executive Government
of the country, and also of the ecclesiastical
authorities.</p>

<p>After our plans respecting the Society had
thus been clearly and openly stated to the assembly,
and nothing kept back, and after we had
heard all that was to be said in support of its
adoption in Colombia, and also the objections
urged against it, the sense of the meeting was
taken by vote. The question put amounted to
this: Is it compatible with our laws and customs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
as Colombians, and as of the Roman Catholic
church, to establish a Colombian Bible Society
in this capital as a national Society, and whose
only object is to print and circulate the Holy
Scriptures, in approved versions, in our native
tongue; and does such a Society meet with the
approbation of this assembly? This question was
triumphantly carried in the affirmative, and almost
unanimously.</p>

<p>I need not tell you how much pleasure I enjoyed
in witnessing this triumph, nor how many anxieties
previously entertained respecting the result of
these meetings, were at once laid asleep, or were
changed into that tranquillity, that peace and joy,
which arise from seeing the name of the Lord
glorified among men. I know you will participate
in the same feelings, and will hail the establishment
of this Society as a new era in South
America. See here one of the happy effects of
the political revolution! and it is but one of many,
some of which are already visible, and the rest
come on in their natural order and beauty. Blessed
be God, who doeth all things according to the
counsel of his own will, who maketh the wrath
of man to praise him, and who in due time saith
to the wars, as to the winds and the waves, peace,
be still! and thus leaving us in the midst of the
calm, to exclaim, Who is a God like unto our
God, who bringeth order out of confusion, and
who maketh waters to spring up in the wilderness,
and streams to flow in the desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>Our last meeting to <em>establish</em> the Society was held
yesterday afternoon, and consisted of those who
had subscribed as members of this Institution.
The President, Vice Presidents, the Treasurer,
and Secretaries, were chosen at this meeting, and
you will find their names in the paper, No. 32, I
now send you. These gentlemen, you will see,
are of the most respectable inhabitants of this
place, and this gives at once a tone and a stability
to our Society. Besides the preceding office-bearers,
there was chosen a Committee, consisting
of twenty, one half clergymen and the other half
laymen. The gentlemen elected into the Committee,
are also of the same highly respectable
class as those whose names you have mentioned in
the paper. It is intended to publish, as soon as
possible, an account of the origin and actual state
of the Society. Along with this will be published
the Rules and Regulations adopted, the names of
the office-bearers and committee, and a list of subscribers.
To all of which will be added a short
address to the people of South America, upon the
object and the advantages of the Society. I have
much pleasure in saying that the subscriptions
already amount to 1380 dollars. I should not
omit to mention to you, that all the meetings upon
this matter have been held in the chapel of the
University, which is in the principal Dominican
Convent of this city. The Rector of the University
and the Prior of the Convent have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and are our very warm friends and supporters.
With the former the subscription paper lies, and
is daily obtaining additional subscribers. One of
our secretaries is also a Dominican Friar, is secretary
to the University, and formerly filled the office
of secretary in the district tribunal of the Inquisition
of this quarter. It is this gentleman who has
written all the articles in the Newspaper about the
Society, and what you read in the English part is
merely a translation from the same article in
Spanish, as written by him.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I have now to say a few words respecting the
conduct on this occasion of Mr. Gual, Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, and now President of
the Bible Society of Colombia. I wish to speak
of the conduct of this gentleman in the highest
terms, and in doing so, feel that I am not using the
voice of flattery and adulation, but complying with
the precept of rendering to every one his due. It
is an act of injustice to withhold the praise that is
due to any one, when a proper occasion offers of
mentioning it. I had occasion to call upon him
at different times, in regard to the preliminary
steps for setting the Society on foot, and notwithstanding
the hurry of business in his public situation,
I always found him ready to spend a few
minutes in listening to the propositions made to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
as to our mode of acting in this matter. He also
cheerfully attended and presided at all our meetings,
and constantly defended, with much judgment
and eloquence, the glorious work of circulating the
Holy Scriptures in their natural beauty, in every
corner of his native land, over all this continent,
and finally throughout the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Castillo, the Minister of Finance, also
warmly advocated our cause, and these two gentlemen,
as well as the Minister of the Interior, have
given 50 dollars each by way of donation, and are,
besides, annual subscribers of 20 dollars each.
The Vice-President has also given us a donation
and his subscription of 24 dollars.</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in noticing to you that
Colonel Hamilton, H. B. M. Commissioner to this
Government, and Mr. Henderson, the British Consul-General,
have lent the influence of their names
and of their purses to the forwarding of our Society.
Colonel Campbell also, the British Chargé
d’Affaires, just arrived in time to be present at our
last meeting, and both he and Mr. Henderson
were chosen members of the committee.</p>

<p>I have requested Mr. Gual to write a few lines
to Lord Teignmouth, by way of introducing our
new Society to a friendly correspondence with that
great and venerable Society over which he has so
long presided, with so much honour to himself, and
with much advantage to mankind. I expect
Mr. Gual’s letter to-morrow, and shall forward it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
with this. He is going also to write a few lines
in order to begin a correspondence with the American
Bible Society.</p>

<p>I have now been detained in this city considerably
longer than I expected upon my arrival here,
but I have the satisfaction of thinking, that my
stay has been prolonged in the forwarding of a
good work. I now set off immediately, and expect
soon to have the pleasure of seeing the friends of
the Redeemer’s cause in the United States; and
not very long after, if the Lord will, I hope once
more to behold my native land, and to salute there
my friends and brethren in Christ Jesus.</p>

Prior of the Dominican Convent; Dr. Nicolas Quebedo;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
and the Secretary of the University. The meeting
was assembled at the instance of Mr. Thomson,
Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, with
the view of establishing a Bible Society in Colombia.
The Rules for the proposed Society were read, and after
some observations from Sr. Gual, it was resolved unanimously
to call a general meeting on Sunday next, the
20th instant, at four o’clock in the afternoon, in the
same place, in order to take into consideration the advantages
or inconveniences of such an establishment in
Colombia; to obtain the general consent for the incorporation
of a Society similar to that which has been the
source of so many spiritual benefits to the human race
in Europe, Asia, and Africa; and of which a correct
idea will be given to the public by means of the press.
In the mean time, it is distinctly stated, that the sole and
exclusive object of this Society is the dissemination of
the Holy Scriptures throughout the world.</p>

<p class="right"><i>24th March, 1825.</i></p>

<p>On Sunday last, the 20th instant, the meeting took
place which was advertised in the <span class="smcap">Constitutional</span> of
last week, for the purpose of establishing this valuable
and important Institution. Upon this occasion eloquent
and appropriate speeches were delivered by Sres. Gual,
Castillo, and Herrera; and, after a debate of considerable
length, it was agreed to convene a general meeting,
by means of circulars, for this day, (Thursday,) at four
o’clock in the afternoon. The principal object of this
invitation is to place the basis of the Society on the
most permanent and respectable foundation; to hear
the opinions, and be benefited by the judgment of the
gentlemen who may assemble; and to determine definitively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
upon what may appear most suitable and in
conformity to the state and relations of Colombia. By
the blessing of Heaven we hope to see accomplished the
desires of those who have devoted their wisdom and
love of their country to the promotion of so benevolent
an undertaking.—We will have the pleasure of publishing
a report of the speeches delivered on the occasion,
also the rules and regulations of the Society, together
with the objections that may be urged against it.</p>

<p class="right"><i>31st March, 1825.</i></p>

<p>At length the setting on foot of this establishment has
been obtained, and its advantages will soon be known
to those who are alike the friends of the religion of
Jesus Christ, and of the true enlightening of the people.
Endeavours were made to bring together all the principal
persons of this city, by issuing upwards of 300
cards of invitation; and notwithstanding the smallness
of the Chapel of the University, there assembled in it
two-thirds of those invited. It is our intention to publish
the speeches then made, together with the discourses
offered us by some gentlemen who had not time
to deliver them upon that occasion. This we promise
to do with the greatest correctness possible. The opposition
which has been made to this beneficent Institution
by sinister interpretations of its object, is not to be wondered
at, nor that strife of opinion which has already
been manifested upon this important subject. It is,
however, strange that any public writer should have
said that it would be better to print two millions of
copies of the Catechism, (the only book of instruction
afforded to the people by our old oppressors,) than to
print and circulate the Holy Bible. It is not suitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
in itself, nor is it consistent with our upright motives
to excite contention. The exclusive object of the Bible
Society which has been established in Colombia is, to
facilitate to all Colombians the reading of the divine
word, in our own native tongue, from approved versions,
such as that of Father Scio, or that of the celebrated
Torres Amat, which has just been published in
Madrid with all the necessary licences: and this object
will be accomplished without in any degree infringing
upon the Articles of the Council of Trent. If this plan
draw forth opposition—if this object is capable of producing
bitter and extemporaneous censures, then we
will be under the necessity of classing the people of
Colombia with the most uncivilized people of the world.
This Bible Society has been established with the consent
and approbation of the most distinguished persons,
actually entrusted with the Executive Government of
the Republic, and the Ecclesiastical Government of the
Archbishopric, to whom it belongs exclusively and
without dispute to watch over the spiritual and temporal
happiness of the people, and whose fidelity none without
injustice can call in question.</p>

<p class="right"><i>7th April, 1825.</i></p>

<p>On the 4th current there assembled in the Chapel
of the University, those Foreigners and Colombians who
have so generously contributed to the formation of this
establishment, and whose names will be furnished upon
another occasion. Rules and Regulations for this Society
were read, and were unanimously approved of as
the laws of its organization. In conformity to these
Rules, the subscribers proceeded to the election of President,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
Vice-Presidents, Treasurer, and Secretaries,
when the following gentlemen were duly elected.</p>

<p class="center"><i>President.</i></p>

<p class="center">Don <span class="smcap">Pedro Gual</span>, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs.</p>

<p class="center"><i>First Vice-President.</i></p>

<p class="center">Don <span class="smcap">Jose Maria Castillo</span>, Minister of Finance.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Second Vice-President.</i></p>

<p class="center">Doctor <span class="smcap">Jose Maria Estevez</span>, Prebendary, and Rector
of the College of St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Third Vice-President.</i></p>

<p class="center">Doctor <span class="smcap">Juan Fernandez de Sotomayor</span>, Rector of
the College del Rosario.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Treasurer.</i></p>

<p class="center">Don <span class="smcap">Jose Sans de Santa Maria</span>, Senator, and Comptroller
of the department of Cundinamarca.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Secretaries.</i></p>

<p class="center">Father <span class="smcap">Antonio Marco Gutierres</span>, Secretary of the
University.</p>

<p class="center">Doctor <span class="smcap">R. N. Cheyne</span>.</p>

<p>In the same manner the members present proceeded
to vote for a Committee consisting of twenty individuals,
one half of whom are Clergymen. The Society
wished to place among its principal office-bearers the
virtuous and worthy Governor of the Archbishoprick;
but this gentleman, with his accustomed moderation,
declined this honour, and very properly noticed, that
the third article of the Rules reserved to the Ordinary
of each diocese, the right of examining the edition of
the Holy Scriptures that should be published by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Society, in conformity with the decrees of the councils;
and that the exercise of this power would prevent him,
as Governor of this diocese, from accepting of the honour
that this respectable Society wished to confer
upon him.</p>

<p>It was then resolved on to print, as soon as possible,
in the form of a pamphlet, the speeches made at the last
meeting, the Rules and Regulations of the Institution,
a list of subscribers, and the transactions of the Society.
It was also agreed upon that the advertisements of
the Society should be made through “the <span class="smcap">Constitutional</span>,”
in consequence of its Editors having cheerfully
employed their pages in promoting this Society.
Finally, it was agreed on that the Subscription List
should lie with the Rector of the University, at whose
apartments all who wish to subscribe, may have an opportunity
of doing so, on any day from eight to nine
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Committee of the British and Foreign School
Society.</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="right"><i>London, 25th May, 1826.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Agreeable to your wishes I sit down to give
you a sketch of the progress, and of the actual
state of education in South America. I shall
begin at Buenos Aires, and shall take the different
states in the order in which I travelled through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
them. When I left Buenos Aires, in May 1821,
there were eight schools for boys in that city, supported
by the magistrates, and all of them conducted,
more or less, on your system. There were,
I think, about as many more schools in the small
villages around the city. These were also under
the care of the magistrates, but had not been put
upon your system at the time mentioned. I had
visited some of them for the purpose of organizing
them upon this plan, but the never-ending revolutions
of that unhappy period, prevented the
proper measures from being carried into effect for
their improvement.</p>

<p>Upon my leaving Buenos Aires, the schools were
put under the direction of a very respectable
clergyman, who, I thought, would conduct them
with much advantage, but, from his not being well
acquainted with the system, or from his being peculiar
in the application of it, the schools did not
improve, but rather grew worse. This state of
things lasted for several months, until the Society,
which had been formed some time before my leaving
that place, becoming re-organized, and arousing
from its lethargy, began to take a particular interest
in forwarding education according to this
system. Much was done through this means; and,
I am happy to say, that I have lately heard that
the Society continues its useful exertions, and is
likely to become more efficient from year to year.
As you wish me to mention some individual or individuals
in the different countries in South America<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
with whom you could advantageously correspond
in furtherance of your Christian object,
universal education, I give you here the name
of the Secretary to the above-mentioned Society,
Don Bartolomé Muñoz. This individual is a
clergyman of great respectability, he possesses a
spirit of active benevolence, and is a warm friend
to education. With this gentleman you may correspond
with great advantage to the furtherance of
your object; and I am sure it will afford much
satisfaction to the individual mentioned, and to the
rest of the Society, to hear from you, and to labour
with you in this good cause.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether I mentioned to you in my
letters from Buenos Aires, the circumstances of
the meetings at the first formation of this Society,
being held in the chief Franciscan convent of that
city. This is worth mentioning, as it shows the
liberality of priests and friars on the subject of
education. The Provincial of the order, Don
Hipólito Soler, lived in this convent, and was
very friendly indeed to our object. The uniform
kindness and courtesy which I experienced in my
many calls upon him in his cell, I shall never
forget. The Prior of the convent was also very
friendly. To the list of our excellent friends among
the priests, I must not omit the highly respected
Dean of Buenos Aires, Don Diego de Zavaleta.
The nephew of this gentleman, Don Ramon Anchorez,
was also a very particular friend, and often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
encouraged me to go forward when obstacles lay in
the way.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the labours of the Society in
promoting Schools in that city. I must also
mention, and very particularly, that the interest
taken by the government, under the direction of
Don Bernardino Rivadavia, greatly contributed to
carry forward this noble object. The labours of
the gentleman now mentioned, in instructing his
countrymen in true political wisdom, by precept and
by example, and his exertions in forwarding the
cause of knowledge and general education, have
mainly contributed to give to Buenos Aires, (what
it indisputably enjoys) the first rank among the new
American states. His name will ever be associated
with the happiest part of the revolution of
that country; and he will long be looked upon as
its best benefactor. Accounts have just reached
London, that this gentleman has been recently
elected President of the United Provinces of the
Rio de la Plata, an honour justly due to him as
the regenerator of their independence of Spain, and
of their dependance upon each other. We may, I
think, fairly augur, that much good will be done
in the advancement of education by this individual
throughout the various provinces of the Union, at
the head of which he is now placed. I think a
letter of congratulation from the Society is justly
due to him, and, from what I know of his sentiments,
I have no doubt of his readily acceding to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
any plans the Society might suggest for the establishing
of schools throughout the provinces.</p>

<p>Through the means above stated, the number of
schools has greatly increased in Buenos Aires since
I left it. The Rev. Mr. Armstrong, in a letter
lately received by the Bible Society, reckons them
to amount to about <em>one hundred</em>, and thinks they
may contain about <em>five thousand</em> scholars. In the
letter now referred to, Mr. Armstrong states, that
he had presented 500 New Testaments to these
schools on the part of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, and he expresses a hope that this
precious volume is likely to be generally used in all
the schools before long.</p>

<p>At the time I left Buenos Aires, there was a
very good girls’ school, on the British system, containing
120 scholars. I have not heard particularly
of this school since that time, but hope it continues
to prosper as it then did. The person who organized
this school was Don José Catalá, a native
of Spain, and a zealous promoter of education.
This gentleman was the first who studied the system
at our schools in Buenos Aires. He was afterwards
appointed to be master of the central school,
and continued in that situation until a few weeks
before I left that place.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you, in some of my letters, that I
had paid a visit to Monte Video, where I was kindly
received by the first ecclesiastic of that place, Don
Damaso Antonio de Larañaga, a priest of a liberal
and enlightened mind, and a friend to education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
This gentleman laid the subject of the establishment
of schools on the British system before the
magistrates, and, in consequence, I was authorized
to send a master to them, who was to receive a
salary of 1200 dollars a-year, whilst engaged in
establishing and superintending the schools. The
person most qualified for this undertaking was
Don José Catalá, already mentioned. He was,
accordingly, sent there with a supply of the necessary
articles for making a commencement. I received,
whilst in South America, different letters
respecting his progress, which was at first slow on
account of the war in which that place was involved,
and the scarcity of funds consequent upon
it. Afterwards he was enabled to get on better.
The last letter I had from him is encouraging, of
which I shall give an extract:—</p>

<p>“The school which I formed here has produced
upwards of eighty children well instructed in elementary
education. These have given satisfaction
to those best qualified to judge, and to the public
in general, in two public examinations which have
taken place. The number of children now in the
school is 208. Two years ago, I formed a private
school upon the Lancasterian system. It contains
at present forty children belonging to the best families
of this city, who pay for each child six
dollars a quarter. The master of this school is a
young man of excellent talents, and of good conduct.
He attended the central school for a whole
year, in order to learn the system well, and to approve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
himself capable of conducting a school upon
these principles. He expected to be employed in
one of the schools which the magistrates were
about to establish, but as it was impossible for them
to carry forward their purpose, owing to the disturbances
of the times, I advised him to establish a
private school. The young man had not means to
do this, as he was the son of a poor widow. The
Society, however, gave him lessons, slates, and
pencils, and Mr. Noble gave him the wood to
make the seats and desks. Thus provided, he
offered to instruct, under the auspices of the Society,
and by my direction,—elementary education,
and also the principles of geometry, trigonometry,
and geography, and to hold a public examination
of his pupils every year. I am happy to inform
you that the children are making very great progress,
owing to the steadiness and fidelity of the
master, and to the six well instructed monitors
whom I sent him from the other school, each
of whom knows more than any of the masters of
this place.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to inform you that the master of
the central school died about three weeks ago. In
consequence of this misfortune, I have been
obliged to take the school into my own hands until
another master be appointed.</p>

<p>“I mentioned to you, in a former letter, that I
had organized Mrs. Hyne’s school in Buenos Aires
on the Lancasterian system, with this peculiarity
in the arrangement, that the children are taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
in English one day, and in Spanish the other; as
she has scholars who speak these languages respectively,
I sent her some of the lessons printed
here for the use of her school.”</p>

<p>The school here referred to is kept by an English
lady, and was just beginning when I left Buenos
Aires. It was afterwards fully established on your
system as above mentioned. I have had frequent
information respecting the prosperity of this school,
and am told that the youth of that city show a
great desire to study the English language, and are
making progress in it. Their parents have thus
shown their desire for the education of their children,
in instructing them in our tongue, and they
have shown their liberality in sending them without
scruple to be educated by an English lady belonging
to the Protestant church.</p>

<p>In the preceding review of the schools in Buenos
Aires, there is much to cheer the minds and hearts
of those who interest themselves in the welfare of
their fellow-men, and who use their best exertions
for this end, in the way in which they can be most
effectual, namely, in the instruction of the young.
To see the youthful flocks increasing in numbers,
and growing in the knowledge of the purest religion
and morality, by reading and imbibing the sacred
oracles, is a sight truly gratifying, and to hear of
this will, I am sure, afford much satisfaction to the
Committee of the British and Foreign School
Society. It will also, I trust, lead you to renewed
exertions on behalf of that country, and, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
your readiness to do so, I beg leave to suggest the
propriety of sending out a person possessing good
talents, and well acquainted with your system, that
he may be employed in extending education
through the various provinces of these United
States; and, in recommending this measure, I
repeat my conviction, that the gentleman now
elected President of these States, Don Bernardino
Rivadavia, will take a pleasure in seconding your
views.</p>

<p>I now turn your attention to the provinces of
Mendoza and San Juan, as these form a part of
the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. In
March 1822, I visited these places, and found a
very great desire existing there, in regard to education.
Our excellent friend, Dr. Gillies, was at
that time (and still is) residing in Mendoza. He
had contributed much to create such a desire, and
was very active in using every means for satisfying
it. It was through his very urgent request, that I
visited these places, I was much gratified with
what I saw there, as regards a growing spirit of
knowledge and liberality. The governor of Mendoza
was very friendly to the establishment of
Schools. A Society for promoting them was established
a few days after my arrival, and a petition
was presented to the Governor, that a small
printing press, belonging to the town, might be
placed at their disposal, that they might print
lessons for the schools, and might otherwise gain a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
little for promoting their objects. This request
was immediately acceded to, and the press and the
types were transferred accordingly. A newspaper
has been printed at this press for some time, and it
has greatly contributed to enlighten that quarter.
A girls’ school was begun whilst I was there, and
measures were taken for establishing schools for
boys, which were afterwards carried into effect.
After these favourable circumstances had been
some time in operation, a storm overtook our
worthy friends. They were like to be overwhelmed
by a spirit of fanaticism, which had raised itself
against the promoters of education and reform, by
those of a contrary mind. The enemies of righteousness
prevailed for some time, but at length
they stumbled and fell, and truth and improvement
again appeared, and prevailed, and now reign
in triumph. Those individuals who had combined
together to benefit their country, and whose benevolent
arrangements were thus for some time impeded;
these very individuals are now the chief
persons in the government, and are thus enabled to
carry their measures into effect.</p>

<p>In the Province of San Juan I found many enlightened
individuals who were warm friends of
education. There were, no doubt, many of other
feelings and wishes. A printed circular was sent
to the different persons of note in that place by the
Governor, inviting them to a meeting in his own
house, for discussing the subject of establishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
schools on your system. A good many attended,
and some were for the measure, and some against
it. The Governor was a warm friend to the object,
and the meeting broke up by his signifying, that it
was the intention of the government to use its best
endeavours to forward this object. I left some
Scripture lessons for the schools in that place, as I
had done in Mendoza, the price of which, together
with the expenses of my journey there, were paid
by the Governors of these two places.</p>

<p>Before I leave San Juan, I wish to notice the
meritorious conduct of Don Salvador Carril. In
the meeting referred to, he was one of the principal
defenders of our objects, and strongly urged the
adoption of the proposed plan. Some time after,
this gentleman was appointed Governor in that province.
When holding that situation, he wished to
use all his influence for the establishment of religious
liberty in his native province. I have great
pleasure in stating that in this <em>he completely succeeded.</em>
He has thus had the honour of leading
the way in this important matter, and of making
his own province <em>the first part of South America,
to declare for Religious Liberty</em>. The date of this
<em>era</em>, for such it may be called to this new continent,
is the sixth of June, 1825. The province of
Buenos Aires has adopted the same wise and liberal
policy, but the first honour is due to San Juan, and
to its Governor Carril.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I must not omit to mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
here, Mr. Rawson from the United States, and
who has long resided in San Juan. His name is
connected with every measure for the improvement
of that country.</p>

<p>In regard to the other provinces of the Rio de la
Plata, I can say very little, but I believe education
is in a very low state in all of them. The names of
these provinces are, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, Corientes,
Paraguay, Salta, Tucuman, and Córdova.
It is, however, very probable, from the general
spirit diffused through these countries, that plans
for the improvement and extension of education
would be very favourably received, particularly
under the recommendation and fostering care of
the President, Don Bernardino Rivadavia.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention before stretching across the
Pampas, another Lancasterian School and Society.
This School and Society are situated about 500
miles to the South of the City of Buenos Aires,
at the mouth of the Rio Negro, where there is a
small fort and town. Colonel Oyüela, who was
appointed Governor of that quarter some months
before my leaving the eastern side of the continent,
attended our central school to get acquainted with
our system, and on going to the place of his appointment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
he carried with him a supply of lessons
for the commencement of a school. I afterwards
learned, that he had endeavoured to interest the
inhabitants of that place in the education of their
children, and that he had succeeded in establishing
a school, and in forming a small society for its support.
To this small society, contributions were
made by the inhabitants of such things as they had,
and these were turned into money, and kept the
school going forward. The conduct of Colonel
Oyüela in this matter is truly praiseworthy, as it
springs from a sincere desire to promote education,
and to benefit those over whom he is placed. If
all governors, <em>far and near</em>, were to act in the
same manner, we should soon see ignorance turned
into knowledge all the world over.</p>

<p>The British System was begun in Chile, in July
1821. The Director, Don Bernardo O’Higgins,
manifested a sincere desire to extend education
throughout the country over which he was placed,
and was ready to listen to any improvements in the
manner of communicating knowledge, which
might be brought before him. The principal Secretary
of State, Don Rafael Echevarria, was also
much interested in the subject. Three schools
were established in Santiago, the capital, one in
Valparaiso, and one in Coquimbo. Some months
before I left Chile, Mr. Eaton arrived there, having
been sent from London, by Mr. Irisarri, to promote
education on the Lancasterian plan. The government
intended to send Mr. Eaton to Conception, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
the south of Chile, to establish schools in that
province, but on representing to the director, that
it would be better to concentrate our labours in
the capital, and from thence to send qualified
masters to the various provinces, it was acceded
to that Mr. Eaton should remain in Santiago.
Our labours were continued there together until
I received an invitation from General San Martin
to go to Peru. Upon considering fully the importance
of this invitation, as affording an opportunity
for extending the blessings of education,
in that interesting country, I thought it advisable
to accept of it, considering that Mr. Eaton would
remain in Chile, and that thus what had been
begun there, would be maintained, and that by
degrees, through his labours, the system would
be generally extended in that quarter. These
expectations, however, were not realized, as Mr.
Eaton, in a few months after I went to Peru, fell
sick, and was obliged to return to England. In
consequence of this misfortune, the cause in Chile
began to decline, and I believe, at the present
moment, the schools formerly established are in
a very low state, if not given up altogether. It
is much to be regretted, that things should remain
in this state in Chile, and that the great work of
education should be retarded there, whilst it is
making progress in other quarters. During my
stay in Peru, I had some notices of how things
were going on, and where they might probably
end, unless I should accede to their invitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
to return there, or at all events send a well qualified
master to sustain the system. I could not
go myself to Chile, although I had a great desire
to go, because my leaving Peru at that time, might
have occasioned a retrogression similar to what
had taken place in Chile. In consequence of this,
I looked out for a well instructed master to go
there. Before I succeeded in obtaining one, the
Spanish army took possession of Lima, and General
Rodil, who commanded the fortresses of
Callao, refused to allow the master to go when I
called on him to obtain a passport.</p>

<p>From the representatives of the Chilian government,
now in London, I have learned that there is
a great regret at the disappointment met with in
regard to the schools; and that there exists a
sincere desire to remedy the evil as much as possible,
and without delay. I mention this to the
Committee agreeable to your request that I should
point out the best means for forwarding education
in South America. I would suggest the propriety
of seeking out a well qualified person to go to
Chile, and if the one selected is well fitted for
conducting education, I have no doubt of his obtaining
a favourable reception, and of his being the
means of greatly benefiting that country. For
the encouragement of such a one, I would say, that
Chile enjoys a delightful climate, and its inhabitants
are, I think, more moral in general than in
any other part of South America where I have
been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>The persons you might correspond with in Chile
upon this subject, are the present Director, General
Freire, Don Rafael Echevarria, Don Henrique
Camillo, and Don Manuel Salas. General Freire
was Governor of Conception when I resided in
Chile; but, on a visit he paid to Santiago when I
was there, I had an interview with him, in which
he manifested his satisfaction at the progress of our
schools on your system, and his readiness to encourage
the introduction of the same plan in the
province of Conception, when we should be able to
send a master there. I have, indeed, no doubt
of his hearty co-operation with any measures
which the Society may adopt on behalf of Chile.
The other three person mentioned will lend all
their aid in this good work. Mr. Echevarria was
First Secretary of State at the time I was there, and
encouraged education on this system by sending
his own son to our central school, and by a frequent
attendance himself in the afternoons when
his public business was over. Mr. Camillo was,
and I believe is, contributing to the enlightening
of his countrymen respecting education and other
improvements by publishing a periodical work which
had these things for its sole object. Don Manuel
Salas is already known to you by my letters from
Chile. He is a man up in years, and his only
desire is to benefit his countrymen in every way he
can, and he looks upon education as the most effectual
means of doing permanent good.</p>

<p>I have only further to mention respecting Chile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
that Mr. Egaña, the present envoy from that
government now in London, will be ready to give
the Committee any information or assistance in his
power to the furtherance of this object.</p>

<p>My arrival in Peru, in the end of June 1822,
and the favourable circumstances in the establishment
of schools there, is detailed in my letters
written about that period. Some time after these
prosperous days, the war in that country greatly
hindered the progress of education. We had
often been scourged by this foe before, particularly
in Buenos Aires, but the occurrences in Peru were
to me, at least, new. Our former wars were
among ourselves, and whatever party gained the
ascendancy the schools went on unmolested, or
nearly so; but in Lima we came in contact with
the Spaniards, the well known encouragers of ignorance,
at least so far as South America is concerned.
Twice was Lima taken possession of by
the Spanish armies during my residence there.
On the first occasion I left the city along with
some thousands, who fled at that unhappy time.
The schools suffered an interruption of three
months by the first visit of the Spanish troops.
On the second occasion, to prevent a like interruption,
I remained in the city, and the schools
went on, though not so prosperously as we could
have wished. The protection we enjoyed at this
time was owing, I believe, in a good measure, to
the general feeling in the place in favour, of
education. After remaining six months under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
the Spanish dominion, in that city, and finding it
impossible to advance, I left that place on my way
northward, and finally came to England. Of the
result of this journey you are already acquainted,
through the publications of the Bible Society.</p>

<p>The Central School established in the College of
the Dominican Friars in Lima, contained, on the
entrance of the Spanish army, 230 children, and
was going on well; there was another school on
the same plan which had 80 scholars in it. In
both these schools printed sheets of extracts from
the Scriptures were used for lessons, the same as
in Buenos Aires and Chile. But in addition to
this, in Lima the New Testament entire, printed
by the British and Foreign Bible Society in London,
was used as our principal school-book. In
this precious volume the children in the higher
classes read, and were questioned as to its contents.
The same volume was carried home by the children,
and read by them there, and portions of it also were
committed to memory. These portions were recited
in school, and premiums were awarded according
to the accuracy of the recitation, and the clearness
of the views which the children gave in their own
language, of what they had recited. Besides the
sheet lessons, the Scripture extracts were printed
and used in the form of little books. Requests at
times came from the parents to have a copy of
these to read, which requests were complied with,
and thus the word of God became more known,
and I trust more revered and obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>I am not sure whether I mentioned to you or
not, on former occasions, <em>the name</em> of an esteemed
friend and an able coadjutor in the work of education.
It would in me be a dereliction of duty
to pass over in silence the name and the character
of this individual. The gentleman I speak of is
Don José Francisco Navarrete, a clergyman in
Lima. After an acquaintance with him for about
two years, and experiencing during the half of
that time his able co-operation, I beg leave to
recommend him to the attention of the Society, in
reference to the furtherance of education in Peru.
I have had three letters from him since my return
to England, and am happy to find that he continues
his exertions unabated in promoting the
instruction of youth, and that the schools left under
his charge are doing well. He informs me that a
school has been established in Huánuco, and that
it is conducted by a native of that place, who attended
our school in Lima several months when I
was there. Huánuco is a very happy station for a
school. It is situated in an interesting country,
and is the key to the large uncivilized population
which inhabit the banks of the Huallága, Ucayáli,
and Amazon. From Huánuco as a centre I am
persuaded much may be done on behalf of these
poor creatures, who, though living in one of the
richest portions of the world, wander about almost
naked, half fed, and in complete ignorance of the
arts and comforts of life; and what is still more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
to be regretted, no cheering ray breaks in upon them
of a world to come, and of the everlasting felicity to
be enjoyed there through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Let us hope, and let us pray for it, that education
may soon begin among them, that the Holy
Scriptures may be put into their hands, and that
the Spirit of God may descend upon these poor
Gentiles, as it did on us in former days, that their
sins may be washed away, and that they may
enjoy an inheritance among all them that are
sanctified.</p>

<p>Another favourable circumstance has taken
place since my leaving Peru, in regard to the
quarter I am now speaking of. In Ocopa, not
far distant from Huánuco there has existed for
many years a College of Friars, most of whom
were natives of Spain. This College has been
made to change its object, and instead of being as
formerly a nursery of Friars, it has become a
seminary for the education of youth on the British
System, and its ample funds are now applied to
this object. This happy change has been effected
entirely through General Bolívar. After mentioning
this circumstance, as bearing on the character
of Bolívar, it might be thought unnecessary
to say more respecting him, as the instance now
mentioned very plainly indicates his desire to
benefit South America, not by his military exertions
only, but also by the gentler, more effectual means
of early instruction. I must however add two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
circumstances more, in proof of Bolívar’s deep interest
and active exertions in the cause of education.
Some months subsequent to the decree referred
to for changing the object of the College of Ocopa,
he issued a decree for establishing a Central
School on the Lancasterian System, in the capital
city of each province throughout Peru, and from
which Central Schools, masters are to be sent into
all the towns and hamlets of the respective provinces.
This is a most effectual measure for speedily
enlightening all the inhabitants of that
country. The other circumstance I have to mention
in regard to Bolívar is a decree he issued
about a year ago for sending two young men from
every province in Peru to England, to receive
here, at the expense of the Government, the best
education that can be obtained. After finishing
their studies in this country, these young men are
to return to their native land, and to fill important
stations in the great work of general illumination.
I am sure the hearts of the Committee are by this
time warmly attached to this useful individual,
whom God Almighty has raised up to be so great
a blessing to his country, in breaking their chains
of oppression and of ignorance. Ten of the young
men sent by Bolívar have arrived in this country,
and are now pursuing their studies in the neighbourhood
of London. One of these was a monitor in
our central school in Lima. The rest of the young
men are expected to arrive here soon. I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
happy in being thus able to confirm, by unexceptionable
instances, the opinion I formerly gave
you of this great man, after enjoying the pleasure
of an interview with him, and conversing upon these
subjects.—To these things must be added the
appropriation of 20,000 dollars for promoting
schools in Caraccas through Mr. Lancaster.</p>

<p>In the lustre of Bolívar, I had nearly forgotten
something more I had to say of our friend Navarrete,
a man who only needs the station of Bolívar to do
all that he does. In one of the letters I lately
received from him, he says, he has obtained from
the Government the grant of part of a nunnery for
establishing a girls’ school. This nunnery is close
beside the college where the boys’ central school is.
This school, about to be established, is to be the
model and the central establishment for the education
of the female sex, a branch of education very
much wanted in that country. May God speed
the labours of our dear friend in this matter, and
may mothers, and daughters, and sisters, embalm
his memory for ages to come!</p>

<p>I believe the Committee is now aware that I
have given up any intention of returning to Peru,
and that I have fixed on another spot of South
America, where I intend to spend my remaining
days. I would beg leave, therefore, to solicit
the attention of the Committee to Peru, and would
suggest the propriety of their sending out a fit
person to that place, to be actively employed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the establishment of schools. I have no doubt
of such an individual meeting with a favourable
reception, and of his being immediately employed
by the Government in this work.</p>

<p>Before leaving Peru, I wish to notice one of
the articles of the constitution of that state, as it
has an important bearing upon the cause of education.
The article in question states, that the
elective franchise is open to all, but with the
express preliminary qualification, that the voter
be able to read and to write. It is, however,
added that in consequence of the ignorance in
which the Spaniards have kept the people in
general, this pre-requisite shall not be required
until the year 1840. The measures which the
Government is pursuing for promoting general
education, bid fair, I think, to qualify all by the
given time, in the manner referred to.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In regard to education in Colombia, I have
hitherto said but little, and that little is contained
in a letter to you from Quito, in November 1824.
In that communication, I mentioned a plan for
establishing a seminary for the education of the
female sex in that city. The difficulties of converting
a monastery into such a seminary are
considerable, and although I am pretty confident
of the ultimate success of that measure, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
speak definitely as to its progress. The last notice
I had upon the subject, was in a letter from
one of the members of Congress, in which he says,
that the question was to be forthwith discussed
in Congress. I hope no long time will elapse
before we have the gratifying intelligence of the
complete success of this measure, and, in expectation
of this, I suggest the propriety of having a
well qualified person ready to occupy this station.
I am thus particular upon this point, as I conceive
the carrying into effect the proposed plan,
will have a most beneficial tendency on the welfare
of that large city (the largest in Colombia), and
on that of the populous and interesting district
in which it is situated.</p>

<p>In passing along from Quito to Bogotá, I found
three schools established on the British or Monitorian
System; one was in Yahuará, and the other
two were in Popayan; one of the latter was for boys,
and the other for girls. The establishment of these
schools, in the provincial parts of Colombia, is
the result of a general plan of education upon
this system in connection with a central school
established some time ago in Bogotá, the capital.
On arriving at that city, I visited this model school,
and hoped to meet there the director of the establishment,
to converse with him in regard to
the number and efficiency of the various provincial
schools. I was however disappointed of seeing
him, as he was then actually engaged on a tour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
through some of the provinces to promote the
formation of new schools. I cannot, therefore,
state how many schools were then in operation,
but I have good reason to think the existing number
is calculated to encourage the friends of education,
and that it goes on increasing.</p>

<p>I received from Mr. Restrepo, the minister
of the interior, a set of the lessons used in the
schools. One regrets to find the Scriptures not
there, nor any extracts from a volume so much
calculated to benefit us, in youth and in age, in
time and in eternity. With this important exception,
the lessons are good, and every way superior
to the trash formerly used in the schools of South
America. One part of the lessons is worthy of
notice. The constitution of the country is divided
into portions and sections, and is read in the schools.
By this means the children get acquainted in early
life with the real nature and circumstances of their
native land, and thus become better citizens, and
more useful to each other. This plan is worthy
of imitation in other quarters. It is to be hoped
that ere long this judicious plan, which has been
adopted for imbuing the early mind with a knowledge
of the statutes of their country, will be adopted
also with regard to the statutes of God unfolded
in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>The next part of what was formerly called
Spanish America is Guatemala. This is properly
neither in North nor South America, and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
has, in consequence, been denominated Central
America. Not having visited that quarter, all
I have to say of it in regard to education is but
little, and that is, of course, from the information
of others, I understand several schools have been
established in the capital and elsewhere, but none
of these are on the monitorian plan. In conversing
with Mr. Zebadúa the envoy of that government
in London, and with Mr. Herrera, a gentleman
from that country who feels a great interest in
education, I have learned that they are very
desirous of obtaining a person thoroughly versed
in this system, in order to establish a central and
other schools in that republic. I hope the Committee
will have this quarter in view as well as
the others recommended above, when properly
qualified teachers can be obtained.</p>

<p>The only other part that remains to be noticed
is Mexico; and for information respecting the state
and prospects of education there, I beg leave to
refer you to the interesting communication of our
excellent friend, Don Vicente de Rocafuerte,
Chargé d’Affaires from that government.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>In reviewing the state and progress of education
in South America, there is undoubtedly much that
is calculated to gratify and to cheer the hearts
of those who delight in the progress of knowledge,
and in the welfare of man. Besides the pleasure
that arises from seeing what has actually been
done in the few years in which these new states
have enjoyed the boon of liberty,—there is yet
more to cheer us in contemplating the general
feeling which pervades the country upon the important
subject of education. During my seven
years’ residence in that country, I have had intercourse
with all classes of society there, and,
through repeated conversations and otherwise, have
come, I think, to understand what are the actual
feelings and desires of the people upon this point.
<em>I have no hesitation in saying, that the public voice
is decidedly in favour of <span class="smcap">universal education</span></em>.
I never heard, even once, what is still to be heard
elsewhere, “that the poor should not be taught.”
The very opposite feeling most undoubtedly exists
and prevails among the clergy and the laity, the
governors and the governed. On a survey, therefore,
of the whole scene, and in looking into futurity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
the brightest views may, I think, be entertained
as to the progress and best interests of man in that
large and interesting continent; and, from this
view of things, I am sure none will derive more
real gratification than the Committee of the British
and Foreign School Society.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Report of Mr. Rocafuerte, Chargé d’Affaires in England
from the Government of Mexico, delivered in
a Speech at the Twenty-first Annual Meeting of
the British and Foreign School Society, May 15th,
1826.</i></p>

<p>The independence of South America is the consequence
of that growing spirit of modern civilization
which, having crossed the Atlantic Ocean on the wings
of trade, has penetrated into those remote countries,
and liberated them from the Spanish yoke. What more
gratifying picture can there be for a true and liberal
Christian, than that which the new world now presents,
overturning a bad system, and establishing a good one,
without being attended with scenes of violence and
cruelties. It may truly be said that the characteristic
feature of the Mexican revolution is that spirit of moderation
and generosity which the maxims of the Gospel
recommend, and which are the best means for establishing
true liberty. Our revolution, in its object, its
means, and end, is very different from that of France:
among us, it is not an overthrow of all principles; it is
a natural tendency to create a new order; it is a general
combination to promote the happiness of a vast continent;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
it is a necessary transition from darkness to
light, from superstition to christian morality. From
the ruins of Greece and Italy, sprung some rays of
light, which, illuminating the darkness of the middle
age, prepared the epoch of the discovery of the printing-press,
the mariner’s compass, and the new world. From
that time, the constant progress of the arts and sciences
has converted knowledge into power, and nations have
been more or less opulent and happy in the ratio of
their scientific attainments, of their industry, and above
all, of their moral and religious principles, which form
the solid basis of true freedom. To these effects of
liberty, England owes her greatness, her happiness, and
that very first rank which she holds in the catalogue of
civilized nations. Spain, that beautiful country, worthy
of a better fate, has been ruined by her ignorance and
monkish superstition; she has only one advantage over
the Turkish nation, and that is, that she lives under the
glorious standard of the cross; and this standard, I
hope, will soon lead the valiant and heroic Greeks to
victory, and thus enable them at length to spread Christianity
over the land of their tyrants.</p>

<p>Those lessons shall not be lost in South America.
We are convinced that the foundation of our future
and permanent prosperity rests on the moral improvements
of the lower classes of society. It is not enough
for a man to know how to read and write, and gain
a livelihood; he must have religious habits, must know
exactly his duties towards God and towards society;
and no institution is so well calculated for obtaining
those great objects as the British and Foreign School Society.
What an admirable undertaking it is, to bestow
the blessing of scriptural knowledge on all mankind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
to unite all the nations of the globe, by the brotherly
ties of science and religion. Ye noble promoters of
this institution! be assured you have many warm
friends in South America. The general desire with us
of all true and enlightened patriots, is for education; the
general cry all over our continent is, <em>give us education</em>.
This is the reason that the Lancasterian System has
been immediately adopted in almost every part of South
America.</p>

<p>Mr. Lancaster is now living at Caraccas, and promoting
public instruction there.</p>

<p>In Mexico, the first Lancasterian School was opened
on the 22nd of August, 1822; and by one of those singular
occurrences in revolutions, the halls of the Inquisition,
so inimical to this Institution, were converted
into a public school, into a nursery of free men, into
a true temple of reason. Three hundred children are
taught to read in this school according to this new
system of education, a system which will lead to the
moral perfection of the world, as the mariner’s compass
led to the geographical perfection of the globe. This
first school was called <i>Escuela del Sol</i>.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the Government granted to
the Lancasterian Association of Mexico the large and
beautiful convent of Bethlehem, and a second school
was formed there. This establishment is divided into
three departments, and directed by two professors well
acquainted with the system; one of them is a Frenchman,
who went purposely for that object from Paris to
Mexico.</p>

<p>The first department is calculated for six hundred
and sixty children; they learn to read, write, and
<em>cypher</em>; they are also instructed in the political and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
religious catechism, orthography, arithmetic, and
Spanish grammar. The parents of the scholars who
can pay, give a dollar a month, which is about two
pounds ten shillings a year; the children of the poor
pay nothing.</p>

<p>The second department will contain four hundred
scholars, who pay two dollars per month, or nearly
five pounds a year. It is a model or central school
for forming teachers and good professors; and these
are afterwards to be sent into the different provinces,
in order to fulfil the desire of our Government, which
is, to place in every village throughout Mexico a Lancasterian
school, a printing-press, and a chapel.</p>

<p>The third department will contain three hundred
scholars; and these pay three dollars a month, or
seven pounds a year. The object intended in this department
is, to teach Latin, French, geography, and
drawing, on the principles of the Lancasterian system.
This trial has been made, but I am not sure whether it
has answered or not.</p>

<p>In 1823, there were introduced into the Lancasterian
school of Mexico, the lessons used in your school in
London, taken from the Bible, without note or comment.
Some old priests opposed the introduction of
these, stating that it was prohibited to read extracts
from the Bible without notes. The Secretary of the
Lancasterian Association, Mr. Gandéra, a very enlightened
clergyman, and distinguished for his virtue
and zeal in the cause of religion, supported the opposite
opinion, and succeeded in establishing in the school the
use of these extracts. The consequence is, that our
children are acquiring a taste for the perusal of the
Scriptures, and they are hence learning to be virtuous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
charitable, tolerant, and free. This moral education
will promote the cause of religious toleration, and will
effect that regeneration which our new political system
requires. We cannot remain as we are; we must go
forward; and, as said in Parliament by Mr. Canning,
(whose name is dear to all our hearts in South America,)
“we must go forward, and keep pace with the
growing spirit of the times, and the great change that
has been wrought in the opinions of the world.” This
great change in the general opinion is, that nations can
only be happy under the banners of liberal sentiments
and true morality; that, in short, the combination of
political and religious freedom is as necessary for the
moral happiness of mankind, as that combination of
the two gasses, forming the atmospheric air which we
breathe, is to our physical existence. This vast plan
of human improvement is the great object of your noble
Institution, an Institution which truly deserves the gratitude
of the world, and the most cordial support of all
who are influenced <em>by the love of their country, and the
principles of Christianity</em>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
